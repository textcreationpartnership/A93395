            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:151353:5"/>a juſt man is a continual Banquet. Thou haſt put,</hi> ſayes David, <hi>more Joy in my heart, than the wicked have of their abundance, My heart is glad, my Glory rejoyceth: my Fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope.</hi> Yet we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that this Light is not altogether pure: Devotion has its Melancholy amidſt its Joyes, and frequently it ſighs at the ſenſe of its Infirmities.</p>
               <p>The laſt ingredient of Devotion is Promptitude and Ardour, which is, as it were, the <hi>Body</hi> of Devotion, and appears more than the reſt in a devout Soul. It has an inconceivable chearfulneſs in the exerciſes of Piety; it hears the Word; it Prays; it Reads; it Meditates; it communicates; as others do the moſt Pleaſant things in the World. It runs, it flies to theſe actions, and undertaking 'em with a Gaiety of heart, does 'em with great eaſe. Theſe are, methinks, the movements that compoſe Devotion; but we muſt obſerve, that in all People, they are not evermore in the ſame degree. Always ſome one of them does Reign: ſometimes Joy bears ſway, another while Grief; oftentimes Alacrity, other times the Deſires. And hence it comes to paſs, that if we conſult the Devout upon the nature of Devotion, they will anſwer us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differently, becauſe every one will ſay, that he feels within himſelf, and that every one feels within himſelf things very different from thoſe of other men. It happens alſo, that one and the ſame Soul feels a different Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at divers times; the Motions, whereof we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ruling by Turns; To day a faithful Perſon ſhall be fill'd with hope in the view of a bleſſing to come, and to morrow with joy in the poſſeſſion of the preſent good. One time by reaſon of his Sins, Sadneſs ſhall domineer; another time the Deſires ſhall reign: and this alteration proceeds from the diverſity of Eſtates, wherein the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience finds it ſelf, and the variety of Proſpects, which Meditations preſents it withall, in conſidering God ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151353:6"/>times with reſpect had to his Love and Mercy, other times to his Severity and Juſtice. Frequently too he will eye his Conſcience both in its ſtrongeſt and in its weakeſt parts; and this may change ſome things in the Agitations of his Devotion. Chearfulneſs likewiſe, which ſeems to be the very Eſſence and Soul of this Virtue, is not inſeparable from it, and ſometimes the moſt heav'nly Souls find themſelves under a gloomy and ſad weight: But when this Briskneſs is abſent, its place is poſſeſt by a ſtinging Diſpleaſure for its Abſence.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Effects of Devotion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN ſpeaking of the nature of Devotion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter, we inſinuated all its Effects: but it will not be amiſs nor unprofitable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold them a little more: for, theſe Effects, well underſtood, will lead us to the knowledge of the Cauſe, and ſerve us for a Touch-ſtone, whereby pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls may try both the purity and the progreſs of their Devotion.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe effects is a vehement Paſſion, to converſe with God and pour forth our grief into his Boſom; to hear his Word, and to receive the Gages of his Love in his Sacraments. You ſee this Diſpoſition in <hi>David,</hi> who ſighs after the Houſe of God, and finds nothing in his Exile more inſupportable than his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from the Court of the Lord's Houſe. Jealous he is of the Condition of the Swallows, that build their Neſts there. He would be a Door-keeper in this houſe, and never ſtir from thence; <hi>My Soul hath a deſire to enter into thy Courts,</hi> ſays he: <hi>I have asked one thing of the Lord, that I may dwell in his houſe all the days of my life.</hi> He avows, that the hopes of ſeeing God again in his houſe do ſuſtain him, and keep him from falling into Deſpair: <hi>I had fainted, unleſs I had believed to ſee the Goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living.</hi> The faithful Soul has no leſs Paſſion for the Solitude of its Cloſet than <hi>David</hi> had for the Temple of his God; It looks upon thoſe hours as loſt which 'tis obliged to throw away upon the World; and as ſoon as it can withdraw it ſelf from the hurry and buſtle of Affairs, it runs to the Boſom of its God, as the Hart to the Water-brooks; as a covetous Perſon to the ſearch of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151353:7"/>Riches; as a Courtier watches for the Hour and Place to ſee his Prince and to be ſeen, and receive from him conſiderable Favours.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Effect is a Joy, which we may call incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, when the Devout in their Devotions feel their Heart diſplay'd, and the Holy Ghoſt appears with all the Riches of his Grace, and all the Treaſures of his Conſolations. If any one ſhould inquire of ſuch a Soul why it is ſo ſatisfied, perhaps it would be an hard matter for it to tell him: but the true cauſe of this Joy is, That God does exert in it his comfortable and wholſom Rays, which are ever accompanied with a plenary Happineſs. The Pleaſure which an avaricious man takes in counting his Money, which the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous taſte in hoping for new Grandeurs, which the <hi>Epicurean</hi> finds in his Feaſts and Debauches; all this, I ſay, is unſavoury and of a bad taſte in compariſon of that Joy which the pious Soul perceives in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with its God. This is an Ocean which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms and drowns all the Perplexities and Troubles of the Fleſh. The Perſecuted find here their Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; the Poor, Riches; the Sick-man, Health; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, Glory; the Humble, Grandeur; and the Miſerable, a general Oblivion of all his Calamities. This is that wherein a Soul, tired with the World, finds that heavenly Repoſe, which makes it with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and yet with Pity, look upon the cruel Agitations of worldly men, that are tied to the rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wheels and Stones of <hi>Ixions</hi> and <hi>Siſyphus's,</hi> that is to ſay, to Labours, that always return and never have an end.</p>
               <p>Hence ſprings another effect of Devotion; namely, To forget this World. When the Devout Perſon ſhuts the door of his Cloſet, we may ſay, he ſhuts the door to the World, ſaying to himſelf, Get ye gone ye worldly Thoughts; retire ye Objects of Vanity, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151353:8"/>approach not near this place; let me rejoyce in the quiet of this ſecure Sanctuary, and ſuffer me to give my ſelf wholly up to my God. The pious Soul after this manner dies many times a day: for Death does not more efface the Images of worldly things, than Devotion, when it takes a Chriſtian out of the World. This Soul may ſay at ſuch a time, <hi>The World is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto me, and I unto the World: I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Fleſh I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi> We need not wonder if the World quits the place in this moment, ſince I ſuppoſe, that it before took up but very little Room in the Soul, whereof I ſpeak. God comes to poſſeſs it wholly, of which he had before the better; for the devout Heart ventures to ſay, The whole is in God, and God is in every part. In this ſtate, if by perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it caſts its Eyes upon the World, it looks down from on high, and with an Eye of Contempt. Alas! What are theſe ſame Riches, ſays the faithful Soul, theſe Honours and Advantages, which frequently ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in eternal Death, to compare with the Riches that God here beſtows upon me? But near to God himſelf, whom I poſſeſs, theſe earthly Goods will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and be loſt; but I will never loſe him who holds me and whom I hold: and Death, which will diſrobe the Living of their Pomp, will inveſt me with new Glory.</p>
               <p>The fourth Effect of Devotion is, an Alacrity in running and advancing in the Practiſe of Piety. A General flies to the Combat when he ſees an aſſured Victory: but the devout Perſon has other kind of wings, which make him fly whither Devotion conducts him. He knows not, that 'tis the drooping and weight of the Body that retains them who are call'd to <hi>Travel:</hi> he has not the Sentiments of the Sluggard, who rouls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151353:8"/>his Bed as a Gate upon its Hinges, who fight Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles with his Boulſter, and wages Wars with Sleep and Idleneſs, with a Deſign to be vanquiſhed. He is one of thoſe Eagles, of which ſome think our Saviour ſpoke, <hi>Where the dead Body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi> He knows that he ſhall find his <hi>Jeſus,</hi> once dead, but now alive, either in the Church or in his Cloſet: he flies thither with the Swiftneſs of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Eagle; nothing is capable of ſtopping him; Friends, Enemies, Employs, Occupations, Prayers, Menaces, Fears and Dangers, all uſeleſs: for in poſting he can ſurmount all Obſtaeles in the way.</p>
               <p>Another Effect of Devotion is, a certain Elevation of Soul, which I cannot term otherwiſe than a ſort of Extaſie, whereby the Soul is as it were, raviſh'd from its ſelf. 'Tis ſo knit to the Contemplation of Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Objects, that not only it has no more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of earthly things, but it has no Senſe, no Ears, no Eyes; it ſees not, it underſtands not St. <hi>Peter,</hi> while he prayed, ſaw the Heavens opened, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Veſſel deſcending to the Earth, as it had been a great ſheet knit at the four Corners. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was raviſhed even to the third Heaven; and the Devout even at this time of day have their Extaſie. They ſee with <hi>Stephen</hi> the Heavens opened; they are lifted up to Heaven with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> for they enter into a ſecret Commerce with God. The Soul inwardly is ſo taken up, that it ſees nothing at all of what paſſes without; and contributing its whole force to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God, no Wonder, it has no more for other Objects. <hi>Bleſſed are they,</hi> ſays St. Baſil, <hi>who are fill'd with, and infolded in the Contemplation of this true Beauty; ſince being bound to it by the Cords of Charity, and of an heavenly and divine Love, they forget their Parents, Friends, Houſes; they forget even the neceſſity of eating and drinking.</hi> And now why ſhould it not be ſo in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151353:9"/>Offices of Piety, when ev'ry day this happens to us in the Affairs of the World? While we are ſtrongly fixt to Reading, to diſintangle a crabbed and knotty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, while we anſwer an Adverſary, a thouſand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects paſs before our eyes, whereof we do not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. The devout Soul is ſo ſhut into it ſelf, ſo well gathered up and compacted, that no external thing is able to move it. If it prays, it is intirely in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; if it hears, it is wholly tyed up to the Tongue of him that ſpeaks; if it reads, its heart is always where the eyes terminate themſelves; if it meditates, it is all over plunged in it's ſubject; and if a Flock of <hi>Birds,</hi> of vain and light Thoughts, come to ſoil its Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> it ſcares them away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently. This is that which I underſtand by the <hi>Extaſie</hi> of Devotion: otherwiſe, if you take this term for effectual Raviſhments, which were the Priviledges of the Prophets and Saints of the firſt Order, I muſt take an infinite deal of pains to believe that the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cloyſter do oblige God (as ſome would fain perſwade us) ſo ordinarily to communicate ſuch extraordinary Graces. Now a days we do not ſee thoſe Devotions, which lift up not only the Souls, but make the Body to loſe its Earth, and raiſe it to the very Clouds: Nevertheleſs, if we would believe ſome, who call themſelves good Authors, there is nothing more common.</p>
               <p>The laſt Effect of Devotion that I ſhall mention, is, a certain Fire that warms the Heart. One cannot well conceive it unleſs one had felt it; and I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it otherwiſe than in the words of holy men: <hi>Did not our Heart burn within us while he talked with us, and while he opened to us the Scriptures? My Heart was hot within me; while I was meditating, the Fire burned; then ſpake I with my Tongue.</hi> We are told, how the Faces of the Saints have been oftentimes ſeen to be bright
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151353:9"/>and inflamed in the midſt of their Devotions, which could not proceed but from the glowing and fiery af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Heart, which manifeſts it ſelf according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Countenance. This Fire we may call a Fermentation of the Spirits of Piety, which not ſeldom make Impreſſions even in the eyes. And hence, it may be, came the ſhining of St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Face; of which it is ſaid, that his Enemies ſaw it as if it had been the Face of an Angel; his <hi>Zeal</hi> and his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were evident in his Eyes, and render'd 'em ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Now this Lightning is not without its Rain; I mean, that this Fire is ordinarily accompanied with Tears. The Heart is heated, blows up that Heat, makes it grow bigger; then it ſelf grows tender, and at laſt the Eyes melt into Tears. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> repreſents himſelf in one of theſe Illuminations, or rather, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of Heart. <hi>After,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that a ſtrong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation had drawn out all my Miſery from the bottom, where it lay hid, to preſent it to the Eyes of my Heart, there aroſe a great Tempeſt, which was followed by a great Shower of Tears.</hi> This weeping does not always come from a Senſe of Sin; 'tis ſometimes cauſed by a jarring diverſity of Thoughts, and a confuſion of good Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which caſt the Soul into a ſort of Diſorder, but which is much better than the greateſt Calm.</p>
               <div type="meditation">
                  <head>Meditation.</head>
                  <p>HOW were it to be wiſht, that men were as holy, as they are Eloquent and knowing? pourtraicts they make, but where ſhall we find the Originals? I ſee plainly, that the characters of true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151353:10"/>are curious and raviſhing: but, alas! the more I enter into this Meditation, the more do I continue confus'd. When I conſider what I ought to be, to be devout, and I examin what I my ſelf am, I find that I am nothing, or that I am not juſt what I ſhould be, I do not find in my ſelf thoſe ardent deſires to be with my God, and to converſe with him by holy Prayer and Meditation. My Soul languiſhes, but it is not after the houſe of my God, nor after the ſolitude of my <hi>Cabinet.</hi> It languiſhes, for it is feeble and weak in all the motions of Piety. I do violence to my own heart, in drawing it out of the clutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the World, to put it into the hands of God. I enter into my Cloſet, to do my Exerciſes of Piety, rather to acquit my ſelf of a Duty, which I have impoſed on my ſelf, than to follow my own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Where is that Joy, which I ought to taſte in the Acts of my Devotion? Where is that being unbound from the World, renouncing of all carnal thoughts? where is that Fervour and Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, the Extaſies, the Flames, the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of that heavenly fire, whereof I am a reading the deſcription?

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The great neceſſity of Devotion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHO can doubt on't, and is it not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent barely to know and to deſcribe it, to perſwade us to it? Devotion is the Soul of the Soul, and the very Life of Piety. 'Tis that which ſets a price and value upon the Duties and the Worſhip of a faithful Soul. A due Preparation is neceſſary to every thing. An Orator who is to ſpeak in publick firſt amaſſes his matter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then aſſays to put it into a good Form: A Souldier being to fight, prepares his Army, and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes his courage. He that goes to a Marriage, puts on a Wedding Garment: And why then do we take upon us to preſent our ſelves before God in Prayer, in reading, or in hearing his Word, in imploring his Aſſiſtance, or rendring him Actions of Gratitude, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having the holy diſpoſition of Piety and Devotion, that are before him of ſo great Price?</p>
               <p>We do ever that thing well, which we do heartily:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151353:11"/>but when the Heart is no Party in the buſineſs, it avails nothing. The Souldier who carries not his Heart along with him, turns his back in the day of battle: and the Orator, whoſe Heart is not toucht with what he ſays, will never touch that of others. If without the Heart we cannot perform the works of the Tongue and of the Hand, how ſhall the work of the heart it ſelf be done without the Heart? This is what I call the Exerciſes of Piety and the Service of God. A Lute, can it be plaid upon, unleſs it be ſtring'd and tun'd? can a Bow ſhoot unleſs it be bent? the Heart is an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> and a Lute, the ſound whereof charms the Ears of the Almighty; but it muſt be ſtrung with all its Vertues as with ſtrings, and Devotion muſt be to it a kind of Soul, that makes every thing elſe to act. Prayer is an Arrow, that flies to the Heav'ns, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion only gives it both ſtrength and Feathers. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a Sacrifice and an offering of the Heart. We muſt not therefore preſent common Riches to God without preparation and choice; and the <hi>Paſſover</hi>-Lamb was ſeparated from the Flock four days before its Immolation.</p>
               <p>Let not the Sinner then offer to God dirty and ſoyl'd Prayers, but pure and devout ones; let him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate his heart from the vanities of the World and the Folly of his vain thoughts, if he will be well-pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p>Without Devotion the Soul is dead, the heart is but in its Body as in its Grave; What raſhneſs then to lay a dead and corrupted Beaſt upon the Altars of God? will not God ſay; <hi>I hate your Oblations, the Peace-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of your fat Beaſts, and the perfume of your Incenſe; I cannot away with them.</hi> Devotion is a Fire, without which our Sacrifices could not be conſumed. It's a Fire coming down from Heav'n; it's an emanation of the Rays of the Sun of Righteouſneſs; its what muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151353:12"/>lift up the Smoak of our incenſe to Heay'n. Aſſure thy ſelf, thou Chriſtian Soul, that thy offerings are in the right way, and that the Flames of Devotion are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone capable of piercing thoſe Clouds thickned by Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that ſeparate us from God. The matter that makes thunder-bolts ſo maſſy and heavy, would not alwayes be mounted in the middle Region of the Air, from whence we ſee 'em hurl'd down upon the Earth, were it not carried upon the Wings of ſome inflamed Exalations. In like manner our Earthly Prayers as well as our hearts would not be able to mount the Skies, did not the flames of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion lift them up. So that we ought to put our heart into a good condition to hope a good ſucceſs of its worſhip. Tho never ſo much prepared, it cannot be too good for him to whom we ought to preſent it. It will be an acceptable thing to be receiv'd in this Eſtate. And what on the contrary can we expect in preſenting to him an indevout Soul, but a ſhameful and ſad refuſal? God does not hear our prayers, unleſs the Heart be diſpoſed to make them; <hi>Seek and ye ſhall find,</hi> ſaith our Lord; but ſeek with zeal, otherwiſe ye ſhall not find. God ſaid once, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not.</hi> But this does not happen every day: this is but one of thoſe ſingular events, whereby general Rules are not eſtabliſhed. But the Law in common bears, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given. Lay hold on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven and thou ſhalt obtain it.</hi> To what is not Devotion uſeful? It is of uſe in all Places, all times and all things as well in the Cloſet as the Church? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we hear the Word pronounced by men as if it were truly the word of God, and receive it as the dry and chapped Earth does the rain. Hereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the Divine benefits touches us, the thought of God's love inflames us, his promiſes comfort us, his threatnings terrifie us, and his Conſolations have their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151353:12"/>Efficacy upon us. Without this, the word, which ought to be a two-edged Sword, recoyls and turns its edge on the hardneſs of our hearts; and without this we joyn the Sin of Inſenſibility to that of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence. By this we look upon every thing in the Church with veneration; the Preacher as the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Goſpel; his Word as the voice of Heaven; The Faithful as the Children of God, and as it were a Troop of Angels, that always rejoyce in his preſence; the Sacraments as precious veſſels, the appearance whereof is contemptible, but which do contain the Treaſures of his Grace and Mercy. It's Devotion that makes our Cloſets to become little Churches, whether the Divinity deſcends, and upon which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its Wings like the Cherubims over the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat; where God ſpeaks to our heart as we ſpeak to his ears; where he makes us underſtand his Oracles, and taſte his Conſolations; where he ſays to us in a ſtill ſmall voice, My Son or my Daughter, <hi>Be of good chear, ariſe, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi> Oh! how bleſſed is the faithful Soul, that God honours with ſuch ſacred Entertainments. Now he does never do this, but when call'd upon, if not forced by an ardent Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe deſires of Devotion may be the Eyes of the Spouſe, whereof it is ſaid, <hi>Turn away thine Eyes from me, for they have overcome me.</hi> Far be from hence thoſe prophane Wretches, that know not the uſe of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They ſay, that Valour is the Rampart of Eſtates, and the Tutelary Angel of the Publick and of <hi>Privates;</hi> that Liberality ſweetens the misfortunes of the miſerable; that Juſtice is the nurſe of Peace and the ligament of Society; that Temperance cauſes tranquillity of mind, and health of Body; But ſay they, Devotion, 'tis alone, that is good for nothing but to render the mind weak and effeminate, and to depreſs the Spirits. Do not call ſo univerſal a Vertue
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151353:13"/>unprofitable, without which all the reſt are meer ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: for he, that having not a habit of Devotion, does not refer all his vertues to the Glory of God, is a bad good man. Do not call that an uſeleſs Virtue which appeaſes the wrath of God, and turns away the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts flying over States; a Virtue which had drawn <hi>Sodom</hi> out of the Fire, had there been found there but ten devout Perſons like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who would have <hi>Devoutly</hi> with him interceded for it; a Virtue, which ſaves the Church ſo often from ſhip-wrack; a Virtue, which in the Conſcience raiſes up and eſtabliſhes a profound Peace and a Divine Light. Do not fay that it ſoftens the Mind; ſeeing it confirms the Courage, makes men run to death as to a Feaſt, makes 'em to deſpiſe Perils, and in its occaſions mannages nothing wherein the Glory of God is not concerned.</p>

The neceſſity of Devotion it comprehends not; whereas it knows, that Food is neceſſary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of its bodily Life. It deſires nouriſhment with a great ardour, and ſearches after it with a marvellous diligence: But negligent it is in all thoſe things which ſerve to nouriſh Piety and the flames of Devotion, ſince it does not beleive, that 'tis of any great uſe. Thou ſee'ſt, O my Soul, ſome, who ſave themſelves with a

If we were devout in the participation of this holy Sacrament, our faith would pierce the Appearance and the deſpicable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to contemplate the Fleſh within of the Son of God, and all the Miracles of our Salvation. But we ſtick at the Bark; we come thither as to a common Repaſt; we bring with us our Indevotion, and carry away along with us for a wretched Companion our Damnation.</p>
               <p>What we ſee in publick is a ſhrewd and an evident ſignification of what we do not ſee; and 'tis a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to judge charitably of the Devotions of the Cloſet, ſince we have ſo little reaſon to be content with thoſe in the Church; if People do ſomewhat for Glory, and for the Pleaſure of being approved, when they will releaſe themſelves of that Trouble, at their having no Witneſſes. Let none then accuſe us of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Rights of Retreat and Secrecy, if we ſay, that private Devotions are yet more drowfie and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; as he who ſleeps at Sermon will hardly keep awake at reading a ſingle Chapter upon words aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of ſound and voice, which oppoſe themſelves to ſleep. Every one hath his Voice in this World, and every Condition has its Fauls; the Merchant is covetous, and oftentimes deceitful, for his Intereſt; the Courtier is ambitious; the Magiſtrate corruptible; the poor man impatient; the Rich haughty; but Indevotion is the Crime of all men in general.

                  <p>I Am not call'd to examine others: I ſee very well, that Devotion is a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcarce in the World.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t children of God. I ſpeak of all thoſe neglects and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151353:17"/>coldneſſes, of all thoſe diſtractions, and vain and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal thoughts, which traverſe the excerciſes of Piety. The principal reaſon of the commonneſs of this crime is, the opinion which people have, that it is a very ſmall fault. There is nothing which they do not ſay and imagine to flatter themſelves in this Vice. One ſays 'tis the nature of the Soul to be active and boyling; we cannot fix it upon one only object; it takes fire and evaporates, even when we believe we can holdit: It is, ſay they, a Malady of the Soul, of which it ſelf is not culpable. Ah! certainly, if it were an evil intirely unvoluntary, it would very well deſerve we ſhould deplore the miſery of the Soul. 'Tis a ſign of a ſtrange Irregularity, and a proof that Sin is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within by great diſorders. If you ſee a man in the midſt of a diſcourſe of good ſenſe wander all on a ſudden and ſpeak a thouſand impertinences and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant things, will not you ſay, he has a <hi>Deſultory</hi> wit, and an ill-biaſs'd Spirit? Is it not a proof of a great Diſorder in the heart, to perceive ones ſelf in the midſt of ones devout thoughts to evaporate, to go and take a leap from ones ſelf and the Subject, to fall into a thouſand <hi>Chimerical</hi> imaginations? But further, I ſay, there is as much of a crime as of miſery in this Evil. It's ſufficient to know that Sin is the cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, to be aſſured there is ſin in it. The Product of a criminal cauſe cannot be Innocent: and I fancy that the inferiour part of the Soul being corrupted by Sin is like to marriſh and fenny places, from whence Vapours are continually elevated to Heaven, which oftentimes obſcures the Sun. Our paſſions, 'tis true, do raiſe up the Clouds of vain and evil thoughts, that rob our hearts of the Suns ſight: but what of this? does it not follow, that this is not a great evil? do not all crimes come from this Source, and are they therefore the leſs to be condemned?</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:151353:18"/>
               <p>We imagine that the mind of man cannot be fixt, which is falſe, and a thouſand Experiments can ſhew us the contrary. Were you to appear before a great Prince to defend your Life, you would think ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and earneſtly upon the buſineſs, that no other thing would be allowed admittance into the thoughts: in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him you wou'd not ſuffer the leaſt Diſtraction. The Niggard that counts his Treaſures, does not hear when any one comes to knock at the Door of his <hi>Cabinet.</hi> A man that is upon an important Affair, and gives up his mind to it, never finds theſe wandrings of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It's true then, that it is poſſible to hinder this Levity of mind, whereof we complain, as of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable evil. Thus in the vice of Indevotion there's a ſort of Pride of being unwilling to humble our ſelves worthily before God, in whoſe preſence all Nature trembles. I would fain know, whether a King would take it well, that in doing him Reverence one ſhould turn his back upon him, or that one ſhould do him Homage with an air of diſdain: and this is what we do to God. We give him not the very Moity of our heart. To ſlight and deſpiſe him, whom the Angels adore, can it be call'd a Peccadillo? <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the Earth be moved,</hi> are very rare words in our mouth. And ſeeing that God does not immediately avenge himſelf on the great contemners of his Majeſty, without fear we take up an habit of defying him. Unqueſtionably if there were nothing elſe in Indevotion beſides the crime of Diſobedience, 'twould be enough to render us worthy of all the moſt ſevere puniſhments. We know mighty well that God commands us Ardour and Zeal: and we cannot be ignorant, how he calls us to take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence. We hear it ſaid every day, that he caſts up the Luke-warm out of his mouth. We read every where, that the way of the Faithful ought to be in a ſwift <hi>Courſe,</hi> and not a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151353:18"/>ſlow walk. And in ſhort, we know very well, that he would have us be eaten up with the Zeal of his Houſe. Maugre all theſe Commands and Orders, ſtill cold we are and languiſhing. Who then ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd if God be not? <hi>He who maketh his Angels Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and his Miniſters a flaming fire:</hi> he who hath ſo many means to revenge himſelf upon Rebels, and to reward the Obedient: he laſtly, whoſe commands are ever juſt and ever holy.</p>
               <p>Let no one tell me then, that this is a light fault, ſince 'tis a moſt aſſured proof that we love not God. 'Tis not ſo, when we ſearch after the things of the World. <hi>Seek for Wiſdom,</hi> ſays the Wiſe-man, <hi>as Silver, and ſearch for her as for hid Treaſures.</hi> Ah! would to God we could make ſuch an exchange of Sentiments, as tó give to the World thoſe thoughts which we have for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and to render to heavenly things what we have for the World. Is not this a crime which cannot be aggravated, to refuſe God the Ardour, the Attention, the fond affections we have for the Earth; a crime which deprives us of God, is not at all trivial? A Sin that robs us of the Divine Conſolations is not to be neglected. 'Tis for this crime we taſt ſo few Delights in our Devotions, becauſe God will not let himſelf be found but by thoſe that ſeek him, and beſtows not thoſe Divine Conſolations but upon ſuch Souls as are a living thirſt after them, as the Hart is a thirſt after the running Waters.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing with theſe flattering conſciences, that the Diſtractions and Litherneſſes of Devotion are Sins of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> and by conſequence, leſs ſeverely puniſht, what ſhall we ſay of a great number of them, and of frequent Relapſes? will this be taken for nothing too? <hi>If thou ſlighteſt thy ſins becauſe they are little ones, fear them rather by reaſon they are in a great number,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> If they ſhould appear light in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151353:19"/>of the Sanctuary, the very reckoning will deſtroy us; ſince, in a word, we return to 'em every day. Than grains of Sand nothing is more ſmall; but yet if we heap them together, we may in time make up a Mountain. We advance ſtep after ſtep towards Hell; and of what importance is it, what brings us thither, whether a great Sin or many ſmall ones? we are ſtill Damn'd ne'rtheleſs. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> that were oftentimes troubled with Frogs and Flies, would not be reduced till the uttermoſt extremity: Wherefore let us not call thoſe ſmall Sins, which find a place in Hell, if they be not expiated by Repentance: but let us rather ſay with a <hi>Doctor</hi> of the eleventh Century, <q>Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou wilt believe ſome of thy Sins very puny and ſmall: would to God, that our ſevere Judge would or could judge them ſuch. But alas, does not all Sins diſhonour God thorough Diſobedience? how then can the Sinner call thoſe ſmall that offend ſo great a God? O dry and ſapleſs Tree, unprofitable, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternal flames, what wilt thou be able to anſwer at that day when thou ſhalt render an account in the twinkling of an eye, when thou ſhall put every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy life into the Ballance, and when it ſhall be demanded of thee, in what thou haſt ſpent thy time? then ſhall a proceſs be made of all that can be found in thee, not only of thy words but of thy very ſilence. Thy leaſt thoughts will be examined: even thy life will be a part of thy crimes, if thou haſt not liv'd for thy God. Oh! how many Sins will ſtart then out of ſome Place, where thou hadſt never ſeen them before? they will ſeize upon thee as by <hi>Ambuſcado.</hi> They will appear to thee more terrible and in a greater number. The Works which thou didſt believe not to be evil, nay, which thou conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt as good, ſhall be look'd upon by all as ghaſtly and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151353:19"/>black Sins. This difference, ſaith St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> of great and little Sins, is not to be found in the New Teſtament: one only ſentence is pronounced againſt all: he that does ſin is the Servant of Sin. And if we give our ſelves the liberty to diſtinguiſh and diſcriminate Sins into Mortal and Venial, or great, or little, it ought to be in this Senſe, that we call all Sins great whereby we are overcome, and all Sins little, which we are armed to that paſs as to vanquiſh: As among Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the conquered is ever eſteemed the more Feeble, and the Conquerour the ſtouter. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then is that man, that ſtrikes a terrour into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is delivered from this dangerous <hi>Prejudice,</hi> that Indevotion is a light and a pardonable crime.</q>

               <p>SInce Indevotion is ſo great an evil, let us try to find out its ſources, that we may cut up this evil by the very Roots. Now one of the principal ones is Impurity of Life; nothing diſconcerting an heart ſo as an evil Eſtate of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; nothing more extinguiſhing the fire of Piety, than the loathſom and muddy waters of Sin. Fire does not eaſily take in things ſoak'd in water: Devotion cannot eaſily be brought to fit Souls penetrated with Vice, one flame puts out another, and the fire of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs choaks that of Zeal, as the flame of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder extinguiſhes that of a Candle. Devotion is a certain alacrity of heart, that diſpoſes us to draw nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to God with confidence; but how ſhould we have this Diſpoſition, when we are guilty of the Vice, in going to preſent God with ſuch offerings, as we our ſelves know ought to be abominable to him? for we know, that God does not care for a ſullied and unclean Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. <hi>Go,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I hate, I deſpiſe your ſolemn feaſts, your meat-offerings and ſat beaſts: I receive them as the price of Whoredom, as the bloud of a Swine, and as a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151353:21"/>Dogs head.</hi> Alas! the moſt ſpotleſs man is not enough ſo to preſent himſelf before God with Aſſurance, and the <hi>Prophet</hi> could ſay: <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone becauſe I am a man of unclean lips: mine eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> 'Tis impoſſible therefore, that he who has not the Wedding-Garment on, whoſe Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſtained with the ſpots of the Fleſh, muſt needs be put into a vaſt conſternation in thinking of him before whom the Stars and the Angels are unclean. And how can this Fear, or to ſpeak better, this Horour agree with Devotion, which is all love and all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? <hi>Let us go with confidence,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> to all devout Souls, <hi>to the Throne of Grace, that we may find mercy in the time of need.</hi> To bring to God a criminal Conſcience, is to bring to him a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt our ſelves to make our own proceſs: 'tis to deliver us up into the hands of his ſevere Juſtice. We need not therefore be ſtartled, if the wicked be Indevout and fly the preſence of God: And ſince Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of life wou'd do nothing elſe than take away the Hopes of being heard; This would be enough to hinder and ſtifle all Devotion. All the Vertues are intereſſed, and he that would take away hope takes their very life away. How then can a wicked creature that knows God will not hear him, pray devoutly? <hi>When you ſpread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when you make your prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of Blood.</hi> It is for this reaſon that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have us lift up pure hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrath and murmuring: And <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>If I had Iniquity in me, the Lord would not have heard me.</hi> 'Tis for this cauſe, he profeſſes elſewhere, that <hi>he waſhes his hands in Innocency, before he goes to Gods Altar.</hi> And why ſhould God have any regard to the Prayers of thoſe that have none for his Commandments? upon theſe Principles, the wicked man ſays to himſelf, why
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151353:22"/>ſhould I preſent my ſelf before God? Have not my Iniquities barr'd up againſt me the Gates of Heaven, and why ſhould I go to ask of him that is reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me? Unprofitable Devotions wou'd theſe be, and ſubmiſſions that wou'd only ſerve to haſten my Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. I cannot have the impudence to deſire any thing without promiſing to my ſelf ſomewhat; but I am reſolved to bridle nothing within me, and to continue in this way of living. 'Tis better therefore that every one holds where he is. Devotion is of a great extent; it takes up the whole heart; it cannot dwell in a Soul divided betwixt Avarice, Ambition, Violence, Pleaſure, and the love of the World. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you ſometime ſee thoſe worldly Perſons, who refuſe nothing to their heart, to have their Days of Devotion well regulated, and even ſometimes to ſhed more Tears, and fetch up more ſighs than the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; you may, without heſitating, conclude, that theſe are Hypocrites and pretended Zealots who would pay God with Phiſiognomy and Poſture, and cheat the World with fine Appearances. Perhaps ſome there are, who believe they are not ſuch badly devout People, when they attone for a Months Debauch with a day of faſting. But they deceive themſelves, for true Devotion is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal nor full of Sallies. It does not reſemble thoſe Summer-Torrents, which roul with a head-long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, and do not continue but for a day. So that holineſs of Life is a preliminary of abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to obtain Devotion.

               </head>
               <p>BEhold one of the great reaſons, why there are ſo few Devout in the World: It is, becauſe all are in love with the World: and this Love is one of the moſt efficacious Temptations, wherewith the Devil ſerves himſelf to diſtract and call us elſewhere. This love has pierced our very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and entrails; and ſeeing 'tis the maſter of our Heart, can the love of God dwell there? can darkneſs and light, can Fire and Water, Life, and Death, be comparable together? <hi>In him that loveth the World, the love of the Father does not dwell.</hi> Where there is no love of God, how can there be any of Devotion, which is nothing elſe but love? what is it that makes up the fire and the zeal of Devout People, but Love? What is it that makes the deſires ſpring up of union
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151353:24"/>with God in Devout Souls but Love? what makes us find a <hi>Guſto</hi> in the poſſeſſion? the ſame Love. What does indue good Souls with a readineſs and alacrity to ſerve God? Is it not Love that renders every thing eaſie to him that loves? But as much as the love of God ſuccours and helps Devotion, ſo much does the love of the World cruelly croſs it. It extinguiſhes heat; it ſtifles the deſires; it eſtranges from God; it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the taſte of heavenly things; it purloins the heart from it ſelf, and carries it elſewhere. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards the Mountain, but hath her heart in <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſhe turns her Eyes thither. The ſuperiour part of the Soul, which is in love with Heaven, makes ſome efforts to lift it ſelf up to God: but this ſame lower part, wherein the Paſſions reign, turns its eyes towards the World, and wheedles the heart out of the Commerce whereinto it entred with its God: <hi>Rachel,</hi> in craving her fathers houſe, carries along with her his <hi>antick</hi> Images: In quitting the World to enter into our Cloſets, we bring with us its <hi>Idols,</hi> that is, its Ideas and vain Images: and from thence proceed our diſtractions, and thoſe unhappy thoughts that traverſe us in the midſt of our Devotion. Theſe are the Idols of Gold &amp; Silver, the Devils of Ambition and Covetouſneſs, which an hundred times paſs and repaſs in our mind, in a quarter of an hour to diſtract us. When we come to Prayer, our head is filled with a thouſand I deas of good and evil, of Deſires and Fears, of Dangers, and diſtruſt of hopes and deſpair, of Joys and Divertiſe ments, and a thouſand other vain Objects A Soul at this rate taken up and imploy'd, can it give place to the <hi>Ideas</hi> of God's greatneſs, of his Majeſty, Goodneſs, Mercy, and Love? Faith, Repentance, Charity, Zeal, Hopes, Acknowledgments, and a thouſand other Vertues, which compoſe, or at leaſt, help Devotion, can they agree well with theſe Emotions that the commerce of the World communicates to us?

But beſides all this, theſe ſights are abſolutely diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Devotion, ſince they fill the Soul with vain Paſſions, and we have need of a free mind.

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Of Worldly Troubles and Cares: a fourth Source of Indevotion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOW we come to another branch of the Love of the World, and a new obſtacle to Devotion; I mean earthly Cares and Riches. Black and horrid Devils, that come to croſs us, that draw us frequently out of the company of our Lord <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to lead us among Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, and that walk, as in the ſad Ruines of our Fortune and Grandeur. There are more unhappy than happy Perſons in the <hi>World;</hi> ſo that this temptation is at leaſt as ordinary as the precedent are: and whereas the World poſſeſſes our Hearts, when we have loſt it,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151353:30"/>we bewail it moſt bitterly. A man, whom againſt his will, a contrary Wind drives from the Haven where he would be, always turns his Eyes on that ſide, and does not loſe the View of it, but with inconceivable Regret. If he would take any reſt, the Images of his Country, his dear Children, and his Friends, return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly into his mind to plague him and continue his Torture. So the afflicted Soul, that would retire into its ſelf, to be united with God, doth ſee, amidſt its Exerciſes, the Images of its misfortunes, which awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken its Grief and draw it from Heaven into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit. Theſe are the Waſps and Flies, whoſe Stings are ſo piercing: whilſt we are fixt ſo on holy Work, and give up to it our whole attention, then theſe come and prick us ſo to the quick, that we are forced to lay our hands on the part affected. Theſe are the Whips, wherewith the Taſkmaſters of <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſerve 'emſelves to haſten us to the work of the Fleſh and the labour of Bricks. Theſe Taſk-maſters are the Devils, that ſay with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> this People is idle; ſince they will ſerve their own God, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double their Imployments: and hence they rowze up thoſe ſmarting and ſtinging cares, recalling into the memory of one; the loſs of a Cauſe in a Court of Judicature, and of another the Ill eſtate of his affairs, an he ruine of his Family. And theſe thoughts like ſo many ſtings, haſten a man to return to his works of Straw, to his worldly occupation, that make him to forget God's Service. When therefore we would eſpouſe our ſelves in the boſom of our God, we muſt drive and fright away theſe Gnats, that whizz about our <hi>Ears,</hi> and we muſt lay theſe <hi>Demons.</hi> And as the Spouſe ſaid, <hi>I charge you, O ye Daughters of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>by the Roes and by the Hinds of the Field that ye ſtir not up nor awake my Love till he pleaſe:</hi> So we ought to ſay, Go ye carnal thoughts, thy earthly anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151353:31"/>and netling Cares: away, ye Devils, return into your bottomleſs pits; let my Soul reſt, and do not diſturb its holy Converſations; do not draw it out of the Arms of its beloved, whoſe poſſeſſion makes up all its Joy and all its Beatitude.</p>
               <p>Good remedies there are againſt this Temptation, which we ought to make uſe of. The firſt is, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfit and deſtroy in us the love of the World: when we ſhall love it no more, we ſhall no more be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the miſchiefs and misfortunes that befall us on that ſide. So we do'nt love Money, Riches nor Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, we ſhall not be touched with the loſs of them. So we love God only, we ſhall evermore be content, becauſe we ſhall never loſe him. The World makes men pay Intereſt for its Pleaſures: the grief it cauſes in abandoning us, is much greater than the joy we taſte in poſſeſſing it: and therefore we ſhould diffeize our ſelves in good time, that we may loſe it without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If we have cares that ſeem lawful unto us, and which we know not how to part withall, let us follow the precept and example of <hi>David, Caſt thy care upon God, and he will take care for thee.</hi> We do not want examples to maintain this reliance. We can produce an <hi>Elijah,</hi> that was fed by Ravens; a Prophet in the Lions Den, that was reſpected by thoſe Monſters; <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated and deſolate Places, upon whom the very Heavens rained down Bread. Have we need of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and Promiſes? ſee that of our Lord <hi>Jeſus: Are not two Sparrows ſold for a farthing? and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your Father. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many Sparrows. Behold the Fowls of the Air, they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.</hi> God that takes care of the young Ravens, that call upon him, will he deſert us? without doubt we muſt have a great ſtock of Incredulity to reſiſt ſo great Promiſes.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151353:31"/>After all, let us remember to think, how our Cares do change nothing at all in the ſtate of our Concerns, and how they turn our Souls topſie turvy, and render them incapable of Devotion. Upon which account our ever bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> would not have us take care for the Morrow, for fear it ſhould trouble our Devotion to day.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in entring into our Cloſet, we muſt ſay to our ſelves: why doſt thou take care for ſo many things, and it may be thou muſt die to morrow? Afraid thou art of wanting neceſſaries for Life, but thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt not, that theſe neceſſaries may be reduced into a ſmall compaſs. Thou haſt loſt ſome Wealth, thou art afraid of loſing it, 'tis therefore God hath retrencht thee of the ſuperfluity. Whereas, how canſt thou be afraid of wanting any manner of thing, when in that moment thou goeſt to find God, to whom appertain all things, and addeſt with St. <hi>Auſtin, Caſt thy ſelf, O my Soul, into the Arms of God; and fear not, leſt he ſhould let thee fall, for his Arms ſuſtain Heaven and Earth.</hi> And having ſaid this, ſhut the door againſt all the troubles of the Fleſh, and caſt them under thy feet, as thou falleſt on thy Knees.</p>

                  <p>ALas! I have good reaſon to weep; Oh that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail my Sins. This is a ſadneſs after a godly ſort, and a Repentance not to be repented of. In this Reſpect, mine Eyes are without moiſture, and dry as Rocks. Oh! that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rod ſtruck me, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:151353:32"/>the Terrour of Gods Judgments ſeiz'd me, that I might be able to caſt out Currents of Water.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my Soul, art thou ſo toucht at the loſs of ſome goods whereof thou had'ſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the uſe, and which Death at leaſt would have infallibly raviſht from thee? Doſt thou not know, that the World and its Fortunes are all of Glaſs? They ſhine, but they are brittle: The leaſt blow ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them, and makes 'em to flye into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pieces; why then ſhouldeſt thou think it ſtrange that Glaſs ſhould break between thy Fingers? Why art thou ſo ſenſible of Injuries and Offences: And why doſt thou make the malignity of another thy own miſery? why doſt thou ſo bitterly lament the loſs of ſome Perſons that Death has taken up from thee? they were not thine, they were Gods, who lent 'em thee, and has retaken them. In ſhort, Why art thou ſo prodigal of Tears, whereof thou reapeſt no fruit? that is, to imploy ones Labour in that which profiteth not, When thou bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, O my Soul, thy misfortunes, thy tears do
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151353:32"/>not make thy misfortunes to ceaſe; but mourn for thy Sins, and thy Tears will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. They will whirl them away like a Torrent or a Deluge, and they will be found no more. Thy carnal anxieties trouble thy Devotion; But the Grief which thou ſhalt have for thy Sins and Infirmities will augment it, and God will <hi>comfort</hi> thee.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THIS is alſo another branch of the Love of the World, and another let and hindrance to Devotion. We love the World, and give up our ſelves intirely to its Imployments One imploys himſelf in Traffique, and thinks of nothing elſe. Another he is oppreſſed with the Affairs of other men, which he makes his own through intereſt: He pleads, as he ſaith, for the defence of Juſtice, but it is too often for iniquity; and though he gains his Cauſe, yet he loſes his Conſcience. A phyſician Viſits his Patients with a deſign to make 'em pay dear for his Services and Attendance. The man of buſineſs is ever thumbing his Arithmetick: The Mechanick exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Trade: the Husband-man Agriculture: And to theſe ſeveral ways goes the greateſt and beſt part of their time. And ſo much is the World corrupted, as they think they deſerve praiſes, in that among the ſundry ways of ſpending time, this is the moſt innocent: but it becomes criminal as ſoon as it robs us of our God, and ſlackens our Piety. The mind of man is ſo made, as it cannot vigorouſly tend but to one Mark; it cannot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>will</hi> but one thing: inſomuch as if thou giveſt up the ardour and force of thy deſires to thy Family and thy Occupations, God will but <hi>partake</hi> of the Reliques of thy Soul and thy languiſhing motions.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend here, as if Perſons of all conditions could give up themſelves wholly to contemplation. This contemplative Life is the Life of Angels and not of men: and ſince that we are in part <hi>Body,</hi> we muſt alſo live after a manner partly corporal. A Bird let
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151353:34"/>its wings be never ſo ſtrong, cannot always be flying: A Soul has not ſtrength enough to be evermore lifted up to Heaven. I know moreover we ought to ſerve the neceſſities of Nature. In a word, I do not oppoſe the <hi>Order</hi> that man has received from God to eat his Bread by the ſweat of his Brows, and by his labour ſix days in the Week; all I aim at is, that the imployments of <hi>Martha</hi> may not hinder the work of <hi>Mary,</hi> and that the Body, being the worſe Part of us, may not carry away the better part of our time. If there be any thing wherein we ought to laud and praiſe the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention of God to us, it is in this, all our time is his, but he pleaſed to give us ſix parts in ſeven: <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour,</hi> and on the ſeventh reſt. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he has forgone ſo much, we ought at leaſt to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exact to pay him this Tythe of our time, one day in ſeven, one hour in ſeven. Six hours therefore ſhould not ſlip by in a day without returning to God, to give him the ſeventh. Do more, and imagine not you can do too much, ſince you owe him all.</p>
               <p>Why will you not have the ſame regard and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Soul as you have for the Body? On it you beſtow Refreſhment and Reſt, and for this you intercept your moſt important Concerns, that you may repair the decayed forces of Nature. Take heed there be not made too great a diſſipation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Grace: call the Soul to its exerciſes of Devotion as to repaſts, which renders it vigorous; and as to ſleep, during which it lyes in the Arms of its God; labour often in this Divine Recollection, and to withdraw the Soul from thoſe wandring courſes it makes in humane affairs.</p>
               <p>Meals and repaſts haſtily taken are followed with a difficult digeſtion, and very little nouriſhment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we repoſe our ſelves while we eat let not any one t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en imagin he can ſerve God, whilſt he is doing ſomething elſe. Theſe ſtirrings and turbulent Devotions are of ill
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151353:34"/>conſequence, and inſtead of nouriſhing do load and clog the Conſcience. We muſt therefore in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary imployments ſet aſide ſome hour, wherein our Souls may retire themſelves, as it were in an Haven, to rejoyce over a Calm after a boyſterous Tempeſt.

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>The Rareneſs and interruption of holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: The laſt Source of Indevotion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE foregoing Obſtacles, I confeſs, are very ſtrong, and the love of the World, its Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, its Troubles, its Employments, and the Ramblings of the Mind are ſuch evils, as are hard to be remedied: But nevertheleſs I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that we may come to an end in labouring about them with much care and affiduity; For the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſe of our Indevotion is the ſeldomneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of holy Exerciſes. Certain it is, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pleaſures are <hi>diametrically</hi> oppoſite to carnal ones. The rareneſs only and the difficulty render theſe brisk and eager. The taſt of Pleaſure we loſe amidſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: And aſſoon as the Pleaſures of the World have loſt the Grace of Novelty, they have loſt their Value. Yeſterday a Begger counted himſelf happy with a ſmall ſum; To day he finds a greater; And to morrow he will be no more ſenſible of his felicity. If great Repaſts be made at a pretty diſtance of time from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151353:41"/>one another, the pleaſure of the Debauch will be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you; return to 'em every day, ſeeing that this will be called an <hi>Ordinary,</hi> the pleaſure of feaſting will quite ceaſe, but on the other ſide return often to God, reiterate your commerces with him; and ſure I am, what appeared at the beginning unſavoury, will become a pleaſurable exerciſe. But if you do this rarely, you will immediately loſe the taſte. The reaſon of this myſtery is not difficult to be diſcovered: It is, becauſe Piety and its exerciſes are by us eſteemed Labours, by reaſon of the criminal diſpoſitions which Sin brings us. Now labour evermore is diminiſhing according to the meaſure wherein we continue it. The Traveler is weary at the end of his firſt days <hi>Journey;</hi> on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he will be much leſs: before two days are over, his Journey will be a mighty trouble to him, but ſuch an one as will have proportion to his ſtrength, and in few Weeks it will become to him a divertiſement. By violence at firſt we bring our Soul to God: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows with uneaſineſs: It thinks the way uneven, ſharp and craggy, but by little and little this Travel ceaſes to be a pain, and bleſſedly changes it ſelf into pleaſure. Is it not true, that the leſs we do a thing we do it not ſo well? The Vertues are habits; and tho Heaven beſtow 'em upon us by powring them within our Souls, it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding gives us them much in the ſame manner, as we acquire them by divers reiterateed actions. Wherefore as no one is a Good Souldier for his having been in one Campaign, nor a Painter for his having had two or three Leſſons; So the Devout do not become ſo by one or two actions of Piety, but by long and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſes. This is a Warr; wherein we have to fight againſt our thoughts, againſt the hardneſs of our own thick, Icy heart: At the firſt and ſecond ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, we are beaten oftentimes; ſo that at all bouts we muſt return to the charge. Indevotion is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151353:41"/>which we are oblig'd to mortifie by little and little, for that we cannot kill it all at once. To day we ought to get one foot of it and to morrow another; but if we let it get breath never ſo little, it will ſoon regain what it had loſt. When we ſhall have come to deſtroy it almoſt intirely, let us not imagin, that Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity will be the leſs neceſſary: For if the rareneſs of devout exerciſes hinders their progreſs, let Devotion be never ſo much advanc'd, the interruption and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will deſtroy it. We may underſtand an art perfectly well, but if we don't exerciſe it, it is forgot. Above all, when we fight againſt our own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for a little abandoning them to their Bent, we ſhall find 'em again in the place, from whence we removed them. Our heart hath ſuch a ſlopeneſs towards Sin as one can't imagin, and <hi>eſpecially</hi> towards Indevotion, Let it be fortified with the beſt <hi>habits</hi> in the World, and let it be thoroughly confirmed in them, yet one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming thought coming acroſs preſently will ſet it all on fire, and choak the flames of Devotion by thoſe of concupiſcence. If the heart be ſo eaſy to be burnt by the fire of Sin, it is, on the contrary, very heavy and cold as to Devotion; inſomuch as after having been lifted up to Heaven by <hi>Machines</hi> and great ſtruglings, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of a few days will ſpoil all, and bring it down again to its old Earth. To prove this truth, I deſire nothing but the teſtimony of fincere Souls. If ſome wordly Affairs, and ſome hinderances, to which you have given the name of unavoidable, have eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged you for ſometime from the place of religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and have made you loſe your Cloſet-hours: at firſt this you doe with ſome ſort of pain, but inſenſibly you accuſtom your ſelves to it; and when you would return to the practiſe of Devotion and the exerciſe of Prayer, you do not know your ſelves any longer, and you feel an inconceivable heavineſs in your ſelves.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151353:42"/>The Conſcience reſembles the Stomach; ceaſe to give it meat, and after much abſtinence, it will ceaſe to ask it: Do but ſtay a little longer, and if you give it food, it will not know what to do with it; it cannot now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it; it has loſt all its natural heat; its forces are quite ſpent; and doing no more of its wonted Offices, it will leave the body for Food to Worms. So the Conſcience loſes an habit of Devotion by ceaſing from its works, and the Soul dies in its crimes and Sins. In ſhort, Devotion is a Virtue, that puts all the faculties of our Souls into motion, as one Spring makes all the reſt in a Clock to move. Wind up this Clock with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcontinuance, 'twill all go eaſily: but if you ceaſe the Wheels will ruſt, all will become heavy and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily unfit for movement. Let the exerciſes of Piety be conſtantly going on, and the Soul will conſerve a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to devout motions: if they be interrupted, it will bring a naſtineſs into all the parts of the Soul, which will deprive it of an eaſineſs to move towards Heaven.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Sources of our Indevotion, and the Indiſpoſitions of Soul, which we ought to heal, to open unto us a way to this excellent Virtue. Others too we may find of them, but they will caſt us into two general conſiderations. As for example: Who can doubt, that the languiſhings of our Soul do not proceed from the weakneſs of our Faith, Hope, or Charity? If we were ſtrongly perſuaded that there is a God in Heaven that knows our though's and conſiders all our ways, that is called King of Men and Angels, opening Hell and Paradice, ſhould we not preſent our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with a Spirit of due dread and ſubmiſſion? But alaſs! we believe after ſuch a manner, as God hath need to help our unbelief. To be devout we need on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become <hi>Faithful:</hi> and therefore the Fathers found no counſel more uſeful to guard us from Diſtractions
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151353:42"/>than this <hi>To remember him to whom we ſpeak.</hi> Can we doubt alſo, that our ſlackneſs does not come from the little love we have for God. One friend does not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit another, nor a lover his miſtreſs with ſuch an air of negligence, as we ſhow in Gods Service. If we were kindled with Love, all our motions would receive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from that heavenly fire. In a word, if the hope of glory had touch'd our hearts. we ſhould not go ſo ſlowly to him, of whom we think to receive coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial happineſs: But I know not, whether this can be counted among the Sources of Indevotion, ſince that the want of Faith, Hope and Charity, is Indevotion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we muſt confeſs, that we often find our ſelves in ſome certain Indiſpoſitions of Heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we can render no account nor reaſon; to day we are all Fire, to morrow all Ice. An upright Soul inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſues and awakens its ſelf, thinks on every thing that may inflame it: It examins its own Conſcience, to ſee, whether it hath committed any thing to diſſorder, its heart and grieve the ſpirit of Grace it finds nothing whereof it can accuſe its ſelf, and knows not from whence it hath this coldneſs Whence then proceed theſe inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? Perhaps from the changable nature of man, who is not always himſelf; and peradventure from the Temperament too as well as the diſpoſition of the Air. As the Soul impriſoned in the Body does not act but by its Organs and depends extreamly on the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its humours; it's very manifeſt, that Devotion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo depends on theſe duſty Springs and Wheels, whoſe pace is frequently ſeduc'd and ſpoyl'd. And it may be the Devil finds his time, and amidſt the good ſeed ſows his Tares, in our field. In ſome perhaps God's holy Spirit, the author of every good thought, has hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſometime. This drought and barrenneſs of the Soul may proceed from that God hath lock'd up the Sources of thoſe Waters ſpringing up to eternal Life.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:151353:43"/>However it be, this miſchief does cauſe much trouble to devout Souls. We need not, for a cure, imploy any other remedy but Prayers and Tears. The Soul muſt ſay: Come Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> come thou Son of my Soul, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe this darkneſs, make the morning Starr to riſe in mine heart. Why doſt thou hide thy ſelf? I have ſought thee in the night and found thee not. Open thy fountains, and make thy Rivers of Water to flow on me, that I may quench my thirſt and be refreſhed: make haſte, O God of my Salvation.</p>

                  <p>WHAT Negligence is this, I find in my ſelf? I take a great deal of pains to do all things well, which reſpect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life; but I take very little care of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only and main thing well, for which I ought to Labour. To make a progreſs in an Art, I exerciſe it often: I conſult Maſters, I make reflection on my Faults, that I may not fall into 'em again. But alaſs! my Soul, thou doſt not uſe thy ſelf ſo in the Exerciſes of Devotion. Very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, thou doſt them; And frequently without Reflection, and therefore thou doſt them ill. Thou doſt them rarely, becauſe thou doſt them without Pleaſure: And thou doſt them without any good, becauſe thou doſt them in a careleſs Faſhion and not with thy whole Bent of Heart.

'Tis not long ſince mine heart was a den of Thieves and the haunt of unclean ſpirits: but theſe filthy Gueſts have left ſome remainder of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities behind them, which render this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle unworthy of thy Holineſs. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, thou Sun of my Soul, whoſe rayes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſoil'd nor defil'd by the impurity of the places through which they paſs, pierce even to my Marrow, put thy Fire within me, which may purge me, and kindle me with the flames of thy Love. If I ſleep in ſecurity, awaken me; if I tumble into neglect, and happen to break
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151353:44"/>off the holy exerciſes of Piety, ſo neceſſary to conſerve Devotion, knock at the Door of my heart, to make me vigilant and watchful: and if the hammer of thy word be not ſufficient, ſpare not even that of Afflictions. Rent me in-pieces rather than leave me in my own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hardneſs: for thy blows will not wound my head; they will be to me ſweeter than Balm.

Nature hath the Inſolence to oppoſe Grace, and this Combat makes the exerciſes of my Devotion to be ſo few: But render them, O holy Spirit eaſy and pleaſant to me, that I may return to them frequently.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>That Pleaſure is the mortal enemy of Devotion: what are the Sentiments and maximes of the world about Pleaſure and Voluptuoſneſs.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have examined the Sources of Indevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have indeavoured to ſtop and ſtem them. But among all the reſt one there is, more lively, more green, and more abounding in Impurites, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence more an enemy to Piety; and that <hi>is the Spirit of the World:</hi> and after having well thought on't we find, that this Spirit of the World is the love of pleaſure and ſenſual voluptuouſneſs. Experience lets us ſee, that this Spirit is ſuch an enemy to Devotion, as 'tis impoſſible to be animated with it and to be Devout. This perpetual uſe of ſenſual Pleaſures does fix the Soul ſo ſtrongly to Matter, as it becomes incap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of any Elevation. The more we have of union with ſenſible things, the more we are diſunited from God. We ought therefore to turn, on this ſide, our greateſt induſtry and indeavours, to ſtrive to bring the Soul back to God, and make that ſtrong application ceaſe, it hath for Material things; ſo as it may lean and adhere to God; and imploy its ſelf about him. Upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151353:45"/>which account, although the overgreat ſenſibility we have of earthly pleaſures, has had its <hi>Chapter</hi> above, among the other Sources of Indevotion, we believe we have not ſayd enough upon ſo great and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Subject. This is a monſter too redout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be beat and quell'd by the By and with ſo much negligence. If we could get rid of that we ſhould gain all; but if it continue the Maſter, it's in vain we ſtrive to become devout. And therefore I deſtin'd this <hi>third part</hi> to make ſuch conſiderations therein, as may, if poſſible, ruine that grand Enemy of Devotion. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, Man was born for Pleaſure, ſince he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to be happy; and happineſs conſiſts in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Good, and the ſenſe of that Poſſeſſion makes Pleaſure. The ſovereign good of man conſiſts in the Sole poſſeſſion and abſolute fruition of God, and in being united immediately and after a moſt intimate manner unto him. And Pleaſure ought to ſpring from this ſtrict and cloſe Union with the Divinity. This Union is made by <hi>Knowledge</hi> and by <hi>Love;</hi> and pleaſure ariſes from thence, that God applies himſelf to the Soul by infolding it in the Arms of his goodneſs and Beauty, and that he fills it with the light and joy of his countenance. <hi>Sin</hi> has ſo far infeebled this Union of our Soul with God, that it hath no more ſenſe of its pleaſures; <hi>Your Sins have put a ſeperation between you and your God:</hi> and it is like a thick cloud that eclipſes the Sun as to us. Whoſe comfortable beams would raiſe ſo much joy within us. The Soul has kept this ſentiment, that it was born for Joy and Pleaſure: inſomuch as being diſunited from its God, it intirely turns its ſelf to the Body and its Pleaſures; and the ſtricter it is united to theſe, the farther off it is from them. The ligament of this union o'th' Soul to the body is Corporal Pleaſure: and proportionably as this pleaſure tyes the Soul to the Body, ſo it diſunites it from God: ſo that ſenſual pleaſures
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151353:45"/>cauſe this Diſunion: and this Diſunion is propperly Indevotion which we would <hi>deſtroy:</hi> for moſt aſſuredly Devotion is that motion of the Soul whereby ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to her <hi>Principle</hi> and to the fruition of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that ſpring from her union with God. Let world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people take the pains to conſult their own heart, and that will tell them what we are about to ſay: They well perceive that the reaſon why they cannot diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Prayer, to the love and Service of God, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are poſſes'd by their paſſions, and inchanted by the deluſions of Senſe: <hi>That is to ſay,</hi> they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely turned toward ſenſual pleaſures, and wholly taken up in them. The Soul is pinch'd and contracted, the mind is bounded when its full of the World and its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; ſo that we need not wonder if God who will have the Soul intire, find no room therein.</p>
               <p>Indeed, a very difficult work this is, we undertake to perſuade, that thoſe, who would become Devout, ought to renounce worldly pleaſures. Although the Corruption of them be extreme we do not place all pleaſures in the ſame rank: we diſtinguiſh them into two orders. There are thoſe which are call'd exceſſes, enormities and crimes: but theſe the World <hi>abandons,</hi> and has not the face to defend. There are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtyled innocent Pleaſures, Dancing, Play, good Chear, great Meals, Feaſts, Play-houſes Shows, vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, the commerce of Gallantry, and Intrigues that are the guides to criminal Amours. The <hi>Church</hi> diſtinguiſhes Pleaſures, as well as the <hi>World;</hi> Both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that there are Innocent ones: But the Church puts the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of thoſe, which the World upholds to be innocent, into the number of criminal pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Voluptuoſneſs is an Idol, to which the World Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, both young and old, Men and Women, Children and old Men, great and ſmall, rich and poor; all ages, both Sexes, all conditions have their Pleaſures: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151353:46"/>much as if we go according to ſuffrages, we ſhould loſe the Cauſe. Eſpecially, Young men cannot indure, one ſhould takeaway the uſe of Pleaſure, they perſuading themſelves that youth is predeſtinately conſecrated to it. The Painters and Poets that contribute to marr and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Mens minds, repreſent Voluptuouſneſs to us like a young Woman, or Man, laid upon a Bed of flowers, environed with all the Objects, which are bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The Paſſions, that are wholly carnal, and have a ſtrait Aliance and Correſpondence with the Senſes, are in boiling youth: The Fleſh all brisk, active, and vigorous, having received no manner of Mortification, <hi>Hectors</hi> and Domineers with inſolence. Whereupon young men follow the furies of their Temper and <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis:</hi> The ſentiments of Piety and the habits of Virtue are not to be found naturaly in them. So that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deſtitute of this Succour, is eaſily vanquiſh'd by the Paſſions. We may ſay alſo, that Reaſon, in this age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires with the Paſſions, and ſerves only to puſh on young people into the greateſtexceſs and extravagences. After their own faſhion they reaſon, they are perſuaded, that wiſdom and prudence doe not become them, they ſay, that theſe properly belong to old men; and thus abuſe the ſaying of the <hi>Wiſe-man: To every thing under the Heaven there is a ſeaſon.</hi> If any one has more happy inclinations, he is not ſo hardy as to follow them; he is ſtricken with a criminal ſhame; he would not have himſelf markt out for a ſingular Fop, He caſt himſelf into the crowd, and lets himſelf be carrieds away with the ſtream: And even thoſe, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Wiſe in the World, if they dare not authorize theſe Irregularities, at leaſt they excuſe them. They are young, <hi>ſay they,</hi> they will come to it at length; we muſt allow ſomwehat to Age: we are not born wiſe; we were ſuch as they are; they may be one day what we are.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:151353:46"/>
               <p>But alas! we do not ſtay there; we do not renounce Pleaſures, as we leave our youthful years behind us: the love of Voluptuouſneſs is a malady we carry along with us thorough all Ages. We go as ſlow as poſſibly or (to ſpeak better) we go on not at all. Old Age and Sickneſs pull men ſometimes away by violence from Pleaſure; but we ſeldom view thoſe, that voluntarily diveſt themſelves of worldly pleaſures: This is the moſt uncommon of all Sacrifices. How many Women do we ſee that would hold out even againſt time, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow themſelves from being carried off the Stage? They forget nothing, that may contribute to conſerve the air of youthfulneſs: They would deceive Men, and I know not whether or no they hope to deceive Death it ſelf. They would evermore be the object of the Worlds care, and have a part in all its Pleaſures. When old age is come, and has lain its Characters open in their meen, they draw a Skreen before it to render it inviſible. You ſee theſe Women, Idolatreſſes of the World, to bury their head under an heap of Powder; that they may <hi>confound</hi> the whiteneſs of their gray hairs with this adulterated and ſtrange whiteneſs: They fill the dints and hollows of their countenances with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening Ceruſe; they ſhadow the wrinkles of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with falſe hair and paints; and, in which they are moſt prudent, they imbalm their Bodies, and cover them with Perfumes, to corrupt the ill odours that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Carkaſſes. In this equipage they mingle themſelves in all companies: they would be ingaged in all ſorts of Pleaſures. They are ſeen in Balls and Comedies, trembling with weakneſs: they cannot ſee to diſtinguiſh red from black, nor four from two, but play they will at Cards and Dice with Spectacles. In ſum, after having been the Idols of the World, they punniſh it for the crimes they have made it commit; they become its puniſhment and its curſe. Theſe are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151353:47"/>the <hi>Spectres</hi> and Phantomes, that follow it: It flyes them and has 'em in horrour and deteſtation</p>
               <p>Are men more wiſe than Women? Do not we ſee of the other old ſinners, that have their members worn and waſted by Debauchery, but whoſe concupiſcence within is as young and boyling as ever. Their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are always vitious; but their members can no more obey, as the Servants of their beaſtly pleaſures. While I look upon theſe men, I repreſent to my ſelf what Happineſs, after the <hi>burning</hi> of an houſe: when the great fire is over we along time after ſee Sparkles; and points of flames break out of an huge maſs of Aſhes; ſo as by this we gheſs the fire is ſtill in, and that it only wants Fuel and Matter. We may ſay, that theſe old men are now but a little heap of hot Embers, and of the Relicks of the Conflagration; but from amidſt theſe Aſhes we ſee the wild and ſudden ſparks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence jetting out one after another: whereby 'tis plain, that the love of Voluptuouſneſs is ſtill alive within, and the body wants only ſtrength to act.</p>
               <p>All men therefore hold clearly for Pleaſure: They are not contented to defend it by plurality of Voices, they would maintain it by reaſons: God and Nature, ſay they, make nothing in vain: The earth is covered with living creatures, the Sea filled with Fiſhes, the Air peopled with Birds, and the Univerſe is full of Delights. Is it poſſible <hi>ſay they,</hi> that God has made ſo many things for our uſe to keep us from the uſe of them? has the author of Nature made ſo many ſenſible Wonders to fill the Senſes with illuſions, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite criminal paſſions? has the finger of God writ upon every Creature <hi>Touch me not?</hi> At this rate the condition of Man is now very forlorn and miſerable: when he was in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> he had but one Tree, whoſe Acceſs was not permitted him: and lo! all the good things of the World are become ſo many reſerved and Mortal
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:151353:47"/>fruits, which no one is ſuffered to touch without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Death. And does this ſhew God's wiſdom and goodneſs to have placed me among ſo many objects of Temptation, if I cannot yield without ſinning? Is not there a natural Bond and connexion betwixt Love and Beauty, betwixt the deſirable things and the Deſires? And why ſhould God have made ſo many good and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things if he would keep me from the injoyment and deſire of them? Alas! ſay they, Are there not enow una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable things, but we muſt ſeek ſuch as can be avoided and ſince worldly goods, <hi>If they be not the rewards of the Bleſſed, yet are the comforts of the unhappy:</hi> why will we not injoy thoſe Pleaſures which are the ſweetning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments of our pains? If you take joy away from the Soul, do you not withall take Life away too? do ye not bury it alive? do you not make of mans life a ſad and gloomy night? in a word, do not you render Man the moſt miſerable of all Creatures? they ſay, Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that religion is not to ſerve not ſo horridly beſet with Thorns, as ſome would make one believe: If we aſcend even to the <hi>Source,</hi> we find it ſay they, more pure and more diſſengaged from thoſe rigors, wherewith Superſtition; has inveſted it: the <hi>Saints</hi> have had their Debauches they have thank'd God, he has given them a Table cover'd with delicious meats a full bowl, and overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cup. They have ſaid, that Wine was intended to make glad the heart of man; our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Author of the true Religion had his Feaſts, and was frequently at ſuch: he was at the marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and there he made excellent Wine to pleaſe the Gueſts. Thus do they plead for voluptuouſneſs, and the unhappineſs is, that theſe maximes do not obtain only in the World, they try to bring them into the Church. They have put Guides and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, that dreſs up a Religion of Flowers, and cry <hi>Prepare the way; make the Paths plain.</hi> Enlarge the ways
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151353:48"/>and make a great road that all the World may come into it: Theſe make our Devotions eaſy, and they cry; <hi>My Yoke is eaſy and my burthen light.</hi> Love renders the Yoke of our Lord eaſy, for it is altogether ſweet and eaſy to him that loves: but theſe ill Doctors render their yoke eaſy in diſpenſing with the love of God and permitting the Love of the World and the ſearch after pleaſing the Senſes. And this is the reaſon why both in the Church and in the World there are ſo few De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout becauſe there are ſo many voluptuous perſons.</p>

                  <p>ALas, what a wretched Creature I am! I do not the good I would, but the evil I would not, that do I. I underſtand well the ſtrength of Reaſons on Piety's ſide, that call upon me to renounce the vain pleaſures of the Earth: The weakneſs, I perceive, in the reaſonings of the advocates of Pleaſure. But thoſe good reaſons of Piety find the Gate lockt; For that my Heart revolts againſt them; and the bad reaſons, that maintain the uſe of ſenſuality, enter eaſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince they are allyed to the Corruption of my Heart. My Fleſh is loath to find the Reaſons of Piety ſo ſtrong: it had rather thoſe for voluptuouſneſs were the better: And on the other part my Mind is troubled while it ſees the force of truth, to perceive in it that reſiſtance againſt being overcome.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151353:48"/>I ſeriouſly bemoan this, that in viewing the weakneſs of Reaſons, which draw me on Pleaſure's ſide, yet nevertheleſs I ſhould ſuffer my ſelf to be carryed away, as if they were very ſtrong: for when all is done, Piety and Reaſon may joyn their forces, but it is Paſſion becomes victorious.

But can a ſoft and voluptuous Life be proper to diſpoſe us to Martyrdom? In going out of a perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Bed, in riſing from a Table almoſt weigh'd down with delicious meats, with an head fill'd with the furnes of a debauch; are we in a good ſtate to mount Scaffolds, to enter into Flames, and, without quaking, look upon Racks and Tortures? whether is it more reaſonable to look for the <hi>Heroes</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> capable of facing Death it ſelf, among our <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that overwhelm and (as it were) fuddle themſelves in pleaſures, or among thoſe, whoſe auſtere and retired Life has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red War to all the pleaſures of the World? But, ſays one, we are not called to Martyrdom, and according to all appearances we ſhall never be. It may be ſo: but ſtill it is of great importance, we ſhould alwayes have the neceſſary Diſpoſition to ſuffer Martyrdom. For <hi>God will judge us not only according to what we do, but alſo according to what we would do.</hi> Furthermore, does any one believe, that the Sword and Fire of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of the Church are the moſt dangerous of all Temptations? we imagine, we have need of ſtrength and courage only to vanquiſh or undergo ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

And it's certain, that my God would have the higheſt purity of Heart; that no one is innocent in his ſight, becauſe he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no evil, but becauſe he has not the inclination to commit it. He ſounds the depths of the Heart, and ſearcheth the Reins, and he will judg according to what he knows, and not to what men ſee. In my heart he ſees crimes in their very buds: And if theſe ſins have not ſhot forth by reaſon of want of Earth, if they have not come forth for want of Occaſion and Opportunity, I am
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:151353:53"/>therefore the more innocent; But on the other ſide alſo, who can undergoe the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Amazment that ſuch a thought inſpires? I may be then puniſht for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crimes I never committed. So that it will be uſeleſs to me not to find in my life either Paricides, or Sacrileges, or Adulteries, or Idolatries, or Apoſtaſies, ſince that I might have the ſeeds of them in my heart, and might have fallen into them, if I had been tempted and puſht on that awayes. I muſt therefore give up mine Account before God. O my heart, canſt thou anſwer for thy ſelf? Thou art profoundly, and it may be deſperately wicked, who knows thee? Canſt thou ſay with a perfect confidence; Although I ſaw the beauty of <hi>Bathſkeba,</hi> I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall into the ſnares of Incontinence with <hi>David?</hi> If I were tempted as <hi>Solomon,</hi> I would never become an Idolater, as he did? If I ſaw preſent death, I would never deny my Maſter with St. <hi>Peter?</hi> If theſe pillars were ſhook and broken, what aſſurance canſt thou have of reſiſting theſe winds, nay <hi>Hurricanes</hi> of Temptation, thou who art but a broked Reed? And if I muſt be judged for all the crimes I could commit, what will become of me, what ſhall I do, whither ſhall I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:151353:54"/>turn my ſelf, ſince till this preſent minute, I cannot give an account of the ſins which I have commited? Think thus for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, O my Soul, that if thou art capable, of thy ſelf, to fall into ſins of ſurprize, and to yield to unforeſeen Temptations, by the ſtrength of that Grace, which is, and God will preſerve in thee, thou art, on the other ſide, capable to lift thy ſelf up again, to break out and <hi>weep bitterly,</hi> ſo as if God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſins as commited, which thou might'ſt have commited if thou had'ſt bin tempted to commit them, he conſiders them alſo as effaced by Repentance, which he would thou had'ſt, if thou had'ſt commited them: though this does not hinder thee from working out thy Salvation with Fear and Trembling. Fear that piercing and ſevere Eye, which ſees and puniſhes thy ſins to come, as well as the preſent; which knows and abominates thoſe evil diſpoſitions of thy heart thou art not accquainted withal, as well as the ſins thou wotteſt of.

                     <hi>THE more I think of thee, O my God, the more I find thy Judgments incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible and thy Ways paſt finding out. I ſtand in infinite arrears to thy goodneſs, but I owe thee infinitely more than I ſee: and the benefits, that are hid from me, ſurpaſs thoſe which are known to me; for thy mercy hath depths which it is impoſſible to ſound. I ought to look upon as ſo many goods, all the evils, I am ſaved by thee from: ſeeing I am but a weak Mortal, and a thouſand enemies that continually are juſtling me, would give me a thouſand aſſaults, and a thouſand times whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:151353:55"/>ſeize upon me, were it not for thy protecting me and preventing them. But above all, into the number of Obligations I ought to put that which I have to thy Sovereign goodneſs, the infinite number of ſins, which I might have, but have not committed. For I may thank the World for the ſeeds of all thoſe crimes, and thoſe ſeeds had ſprouted firſt and grown up to the height of the Cedars of</hi> Libanus, <hi>if thy good Grace had not choak'd them. I am envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with Temptations, and there is not one of them but is allyed to ſome motion of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence: inſomuch that if thy Grace were not a Bridle to my heart, that tames and breaks it, it would fling out every moment, and take its full ſwing in diſſoluteneſs. So I acknowledge, O my God,
<note place="margin">St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin.</note> that to thee I owe all the good I have, and all the evil I have not; I owe to thee the Remiſſion of all the ſins I have commited, becauſe thou haſt pardoned them; and I look upon as pardoned all thoſe I have not commited, becauſe thy Grace hath prevented my committing them. This teaches me in what manner</hi> I <hi>ought to underſtand that which thou haſt told me, O my Saviour, To whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little. This was to diſcover the proud Phariſee, to whom thou ſpakeſt, the ſource of his Indevotion and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:151353:55"/>his little love. He believ'd he had leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to thy Mercy, becauſe having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted fewer ſins, as he thought, he believ'd he owed thee much leſs. As for me, I ſay, to whom leſſer is forgiven, the ſame loveth more. Yes, O my God, I have more obligation for the ſins which thou haſt prevented my committing, than for thoſe, thou haſt remitted me: It is a much greater good to render a man invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, than to cure him of the Wounds he has received; it is better never to fall into the Fire and Water, than to be drawn out thence with the peril of continuing there: And it is more happy alwayes to be well, than to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a ſickneſs. But above all, ſince it is a great unhappineſs to have offended thee, O God, 'tis a much greater bleſſing to have bin preſerved from ſin by thy Grace, than to re-enter into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after having violated thy moſt ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. O my Redeemer, deliver me then from all iniquity to come, prevent me in all my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings, dry up the ſource of my crimes, root every ill diſpoſition out of my heart, diſpoſe me to all the Vertues; that I may be judg'd in thy ſight to have fulfill'd all Righteouſneſs, that</hi> I <hi>may be rewarded even for the good works</hi> I <hi>had not done, becauſe</hi> I <hi>had an intention to do them.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Other Conſiderations upon this Truth: That the pleaſures of ſenſe, nor in their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, nor in their Abuſe, agree with the ſpirit of Chriſtianity and Devotion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Pleaſures of the World are for the ſenſes, or for the imaginations. Now theſe faculties are corporeal, and conſequently all their pleaſures are corporeal too: this is enough to teach thoſe that would follow <hi>the mind of the Goſpel</hi> that they cannot lawfully ſeek them. For the Goſpel, of our Lord Chriſt leads Men to neglect and contemn that Body: And therefore it ſpeaks of it with ſo much Slight. According to the ſtyle of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>The Body is but Duſt and Aſhes, an earthly Tabernacle, an Houſe of Clay deſtroyed by Worms, a Flower that cometh forth and is cut down, a River that runneth apace, a Shadow which diſappears, a Dream which vaniſheth away, a Smoke which is conſumed in its lifting up.</hi> And as it ſpeaks of it with contempt, ſo it would alſo that we have little care of it. <hi>Take no care of the Body</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, to obey the luſts thereof. Take no thought for the morrow; the morrow ſhall take thought for the things of its ſelf:</hi> be in litttle pain <hi>for what ye ſhall eat, or wherewithal ye ſhall be clothed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Soul, the holy Spirit would have us turn all our cares on that ſide. He would have us vigilant and ſober, becauſe the Devil watches about it as a roaring Lyon, ſeeking to devour it. He commands us to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling, and that we be in a perpetual ſolicitude about it. He Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:151353:56"/>us to nouriſh it with the milk of the Word, ſincere and without deceit, and that we furniſh it with ſtrong meats. He wiſhes us to entertain it continually in an holy joy. He would have us ſearch after thoſe ſovereign pleaſures that are to be found in the poſſeſſion of God, which are only for the Soul. The Goſpel requires of us to imbelliſh it, and that we labour to adorn it, that it may be found a glorious <hi>Spouſe</hi> not having ſpot or wrinkle, worthy to be preſented to its head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Examine the conduct of Voluptuous men; it is quite contrary to this: they act as if they were all Fleſh, and as if their Soul were only Salt to keep the Body from corrupting. All the <hi>Ideas</hi> they have of Pleaſure, derive from the Senſes and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and without a metaphor, they are (as they call themſelves) Men of Senſe, and they conceive no more what we call ſpiritual pleaſures, than blind men do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. As therefore, they never taſted other delights than bodily ones, they believe themſelves oblig'd to the Body for all their Happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in effect ſo it is: For at the time when they taſte carnal Pleaſures, we cannot ſay they are unhappy, ſince happineſs conſiſts in Pleaſure and Joy, and they have them at that moment: So that becauſe we intirely love what we conſider as the ſource of our felicity, we cannot think it ſtrange that theſe worldly People love their body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, which they look upon as the only Source of their Pleaſures. We ſee alſo, that theſe men have the ſame Sentiments for their Body as holy men have for God, who is their ſovereign good, and in whom they find their ſovereign pleaſure. They adore this Body of theirs, they cheriſh, they perfume it, they offer Incenſe and Sacrifice to it: If one ſhould give a blow or a gird to this ſame Body, Oh! how jealous they are on't as of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. More Indignation they have againſt him that ſhould hurt this Fleſh, than againſt a Blaſphemer or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:151353:57"/>Perſon. In a word, their Body holds ſo much of a Divinity, that they Sacrifice unto it, even their very Conſcience, nay and God himſelf. But nothing is more oppoſite to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity and Devotion than this Sentiment. For the truly faithful ones are oblig'd to ſlight the Body, to ſacrifice it to God, to ſee it torn in pieces for his name, and to renounce all the pleaſures of ſenſe for his Glory.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of the Goſpel and of Devotion abſolutely tends to the contempt of the World; but the ſpirit of Voluptuouſneſs and ſenſuality to the love of the World. How muſt we love the World, when it careſſes us, and is mighty kind and pleaſurable to us, if we love it when it perſecutes us and ſteeps us in Gall? The World is a mere Cheat and Gull, and an undeniable Source of Deluſions: it maſques it ſelf, and would be ſeen by us under the image of fleſhly pleaſure: It imbraces us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the habit of Flowers, but under theſe Flowers are a thouſand Thorns. We do not ſee theſe thorns, we only ſmell the Flowers; we are ſenſible of ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and love that cauſes them: But all the World knows, nought is more contrary to Devotion than the love of the World, and we have made it appear elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: ſo as by conſequence nothing is more oppoſite to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity and Devotion than ſenſual Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Chriſtian Religion would inſpire a contempt of the preſent, and a deſire after the other Life. Now certain it is, that nothing tyes men ſo much to Life, as the pleaſures of Senſe: the Saints ſay, and ought to ſay, <hi>I deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt which is far better. I know, when this earthly houſe ſhall be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, we have an Houſe eternal in the Heavens; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire to be clothed upon with our Houſe which is from Heaven. None of theſe things moving, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf. As the hart panteth after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-brooks,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:151353:57"/>ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God. When ſhall I come, and appear before God?</hi> It's impoſſible that men, who live in a perpetual uſe of Voluptuouſneſs, ſhould have theſe thoughts. Every one wiſhes to be happy, and when once he is, or at leaſt believes he is ſo, he cannot renounce what he fancies the cauſe of his felicity: theſe carnal-minded men think themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py at ſuch time as they injoy their Pleaſures; they have no <hi>Idea</hi> of any other Beatitude but of that they injoy in this preſent life. They can every day ſpeak both about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life, and another happineſs: But they have got an habit not to let themſelves be touch'd but by ſenſe and Imagination: and ſo becauſe this life and this happineſs do not fall under their Senſes; nor can be imagined by them, they cannot conſider them but as imaginary Beings, which have no relation to them; becauſe they have not any <hi>Idea</hi> of them in their minds. Moreover their hearts meeting in this life with a <hi>fat Land,</hi> that is, much proſperity, do take very deep rooting there. Their affections being thoroughly ingaged in carnal pleaſures, bound themſelves in the poſſeſſion of Senſible Objects: they wiſh for nothing more beſides, for that no body wiſhes for things which he does not know, and whereof he has no clear and certain <hi>Ideas:</hi> The Earth becomes their Country, they naturalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves here; every thing elſe is a ſtrange and unknown Land.</p>
               <p>Let people ſay what they pleaſe: but queſtionleſs we have an ill preparation for Death in the continual uſe of thoſe pleaſures, whoſe Innocence the World maintains. <hi>O Death,</hi> ſaid a Wiſe Man, <hi>how cruel is the remembrance of thee to him that lives quietly among his Poſſeſſions.</hi> One lives indeed more commodiouſly in a Palace than in a Priſon; but one finds it more trouble to dye in that than in this. How inſupportable is the thought of Death, his preſence how affrightful to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:151353:58"/>him, who lives in the midſt of Pleaſures! he looks upon Death as a Judge that comes to pronounce on him a diſmal Sentence; or an Executioner, that ſeizes him to be lead to puniſhment. But the faithful one, who has ever held his <hi>Fleſh</hi> in an intire Privation of Carnal Pleaſures, fancies Death as a Meſſenger that brings him good news, as a deliverer that is come to throw down the four Walls of his Priſon down to the Ground, and will leave a paſſage free on all ſides to flye away to Heaven. The Voluptuous they muſt be dragg'd to death; they lay hold on every thing in the way to ſtop themſelves: they give place to neceſſity, but they do it with an aukward and ill grace. Theſe therefore, who multiply the pleaſures of their Senſes, make themſelves Chains, the breaking whereof will coſt them many a groan and many a tear. But pious people who have renounc'd the pleaſures of life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in pain to forſake the preſent life, ſince they have quitted that which life has moſt agreeable.</p>
               <p>I ſhould ſay here, that the Pleaſures of Senſe are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Devotion, becauſe they abſolutely take away the taſte of the Spiritual Pleaſures which the faithful find in the commerce they have with God; but that I have ſaid it already, and it is ſo evident both in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience. We know, that thoſe Slaves of ſenſual Pleaſures look upon all that is ſaid of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Devotion as mere idle Stories. Speak to them of the delights which the faithful Soul taſts when God ſpeaks to it within its heart, and during, the ſilence of its paſſions, of the ſweetneſs it finds in meditating on the Love he hath for us, and in contemplating on its Myſteries; All this will appear to them as Dream and Viſion.</p>
               <p>Undoubtedly, one is not ſenſible of the pleaſures of the Mind, but in proportion, as he hath renounc'd thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Body. And therefore we <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are all ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:151353:58"/>little touch'd with Spiritual pleaſures, with Prayer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, Contemplation; becauſe we are not of thoſe who have perfectly renounced Senſual pleaſures. In this reſpect, we muſt confeſs Rich and Great men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to great Temptations: their condition, <hi>ſay they,</hi> obliges them to draw after them a great equipage of Pleaſures; if it be ſo, they are very unhappy: And in proſpect to this, it may be, our Saviour ſaid; <hi>How hard a thing is it for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> Riches and Grandeur are continual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to Voluptuouſneſs, and it's very difficult for him that is always tempted, not to yield ſometimes. But although Moderation and Temperance are praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, when they are kept amid ſo many Enemies that conſpire their ruin, it is very rarely ſo; and therefore Devotion is not ſo common among them, who, by their Rank, fancy themſelves obliged to live evermore in Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, if it be permitted us to draw proofs from Examples, as without doubt it ought to be, we may eaſily prove, that the Spirit of Devotion and Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are enemies to Senſual Pleaſures. Whether are the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of our age, that live with a freedom, which auſtere morality calls <hi>Libertinage,</hi> better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, than the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of former ages, who led a moſt ſevere and rigorous life? Many there have been, who not finding a retreat ſecure enough, in the World, againſt the temptations of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs, have gone to ſeek it in Deſarts, where they found none but pure and innocent Objects: ſome have worn Sack-cloth as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> and others reſiding in humane Society have prefer'd Faſtings and mortification of the Body before Pleaſures of the Senſe. Do ye believe, that theſe people were wiſer than us, or are we wiſer than them? I know ſome will not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate on the matter, but file theſe Auſterities to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:151353:59"/>account of Fanaticiſm and Deluſion of the Spirit of Errour. But certainly, this is a raſh Judgment, for which we appeal to the Tribunal of God, to whom alone appertains the right of diſtinguiſhing Sincerity from Hypocriſie in ſuch auſtere lives.</p>
               <p>But would we have an example that is not ſubject to errour, let us look up to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: had his life any thing common with ſenſual pleaſures? You ſee him born in a Stable, brought up in the houſe of a Carpenter: you ſee him faſt forty days in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; you ſee him live on the Alms of Women that followed him. We hear him declaring, that he had not whereon to lay his head: We ſee him go on foot and without equipage, from City to City. And does this now reliſh of the Spirit of the World, and a delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life? Who can know better what is the ſpirit of Chriſtianity than our Saviour himſelf, and what are the effects of Devotion, but he who was perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his Father? after this, let none tell me, that our Lord was no enemy to Pleaſures, becauſe he was preſent at Feaſts and Nuptials. It were to be wiſh'd that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt were at all our Feaſts; We ſhould not ſee Inſolence and Debauchery to reign there, Wiſdom, Temperance, Sobriety, and the higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration would march in his Train.</p>

Thou haſt great need, O my heart, both to mortifie thy ſelf and to repent: ſo as it would be very neceſſary that thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould carry Sack-cloath and Aſhes. But this example of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> does not become a Law; and if thy God hath not commanded it thee, thou canſt not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereby. Behold then another exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, another model much more perfect which thou oughteſt to follow; and that is of thy Saviour, the pattern by whoſe traces thou oughteſt to guide thy ſteps. Live as he did, and thou wilt live well enough.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:151353:60"/>The Diſciple ſhould not hope to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his Maſter.

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>What may be accounted innocent Pleaſure. That Devotion is no diſquieting and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing, nor an Enemy to Pleaſure.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN the foregoing <hi>Chapters</hi> I have proved, that the Spirit of Devotion is an Enemy to ſenſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and not only to thoſe Pleaſures, which, 'tis confeſt on all hands, are criminal, but to thoſe too that we call innocent ones. In this rank I have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the continual Divertiſements, whereunto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of mankind give 'emſelves up. It is time now to explain and unfold a queſtion, which may be ſtarted here, To know, whether it be neceſſary to renousce all ſort of Pleaſure to be <hi>Chriſtianly</hi> and truly pious? Now in one word the anſwer cannot be return'd, it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151353:62"/>being one of the moſt nice and delicate matters in <hi>Chriſtian Morality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, firſt of all, That Devotion is no Enemy to Joy, it ſuffers us to diſtinguiſh betwixt innocent and ſinful Pleaſures; it is neither fierce nor brutiſh: It ought to be courteous, civil, ſweet, and modeſt: It flies ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor does it inveſt it ſelf with flowers, yet it affects not to appear beſet with Thorns nor habilimented with Prickles. In ſhort, 'tis not neceſſary, That a faithful perſon, to be ſincerely devout, ſhould nouriſh, in himſelf, a penſive and lumpiſh melancholy: On the contrary, Piety is all gay and free: <hi>The Heart of the righteous man is a continual Feaſt.</hi> Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> would not have us affect a gloomy Viſage, or an abaſed Air; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us even when we faſt and are mortifying our ſelves to anoint our Heads when we muſt be ſeen by men, that we may avoid Oſtentation in our Piety.</p>

               <p>Firſt, all the Pleaſures are either of the Mind, or of the Senſes: Among the Senſes ſome are more viſible yed, to matter, others are more diſengaged from them. Of the firſt order are the Taſte and Touch: Of the latter, he Sight and Hearing. The more ſpiritual the Pleaſures are, the more eaſie it is to render them innocent: The more material they are, the more common they are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:151353:63"/>of Life; theſe Actions are eating drinking, and ſleeping. Theſe Pleaſures cannot be enemies to Piety, and Vertue. God is the Author of them; he has put certain Relations between us and their Objects; he hath joyned Pleaſure to certain Actions, that we might love to do them, and, without perplexity, work what is neceſſary to our Conſervation.

And that which ſerves to deceive us in this, is, that neceſſity has not the ſame extent as Pleaſure hath; there being oftentimes enough for neceſſity, when there is but a little for Pleaſure. We are alſo frequently uncertain, whether it be the need that we have to ſuſtain life that conveys us to eating, or whether it be the enchanting deceit of Pleaſure which hurries us away. Our unfortunate ſoul pleaſes it ſelf with this uncertainty, and ſtrives to find out excuſes to defend it's ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſight and hearing, do they furniſh us with pleaſures more pure and leſs carnal? Brutes are not accquainted with them: they are peculiar to men: If beaſts find pleaſure in the ſight of certain objects, it's alwayes in relation to taſting and touching; whereof alone they are ſenſible. Nevertheleſs it is certain that among the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to the Eye and Ear, there are many ſinful ones: and they are thoſe, which have a particular and near alliance with the corruption of our heart and mind, and are capable of awakening this Corruption. Of this order are obſcene Pourtraits and Figures, laſcivious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, the ſights of Theatres, Beauties, loaden with borrowed Ornaments, accompanied with Geſtures, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Speeches, proper to enflame luſt; when we uſe thoſe pleaſures we alwayes abuſe the Senſes; for this uſe of them is unlawful. But among the Pleaſures of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151353:64"/>ſeeing and hearing we may find innocent ones, and theſe are almoſt thoſe only which come from the hand of God, without paſſing through the hands of Men; for man hath this unhappineſs, that he leaves the traces of his Corruption in what ever he handles. There can be no ſin in looking with Pleaſure and Admiration upon the Beauty of the Heavens, their Order, their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their Light; upon pleaſant Landskips, green Meadows, the delightſom obſcurity of a Forreſt, or a River, that creeps between two Mountains. No fault is to be found with the Pleaſure of a murmuring Stream, nor in the innocent Muſick of a Multitude of Birds, that are rejoycing at the return of the Spring. None of theſe Pleaſures diſturb or diſquiet the Soul: ſweet, and not at all violent are their Impreſſions: They are not capable of carrying the Soul from without it's ſelf: and therefore they are well enough beloved by Piety. Theſe natural and pure <hi>Ideas</hi> may excite motions of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the great Creator, and Acknowledgement for their Authour, and conſequently they may inſpire Devotion for the Deity.</p>
               <p>Other bodily Pleaſures there are, which I can't well refer to any of the Senſes: and therefore we'l call them <hi>Pleaſures of Imagination.</hi> Of this order is the Pleaſure of having fine Houſes, rich Furniture, magnificent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, a great Train, and of having our eſtate prey'd upon by a vaſt number of People: theſe Pleaſures are not without crime, ſeeing they are not without errour: theſe are pleaſures of Imagination, and therefore they have deluſion in them; and if deluſion, then Vanity; and if Vanity, then Sin. Wherefore the wiſe man cryes out upon all this, <hi>Vanity of Vanities.</hi> But there is more than Impoſture herein, we find Pride likewiſe. The pleaſure we take from this vain Pomp, Luxury, and Magnificence, proceeds from a deſire we have to be Great, and a pleaſure we take to appear ſo. We are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:151353:64"/>very prone to deceive Men, and we try to deceive our ſelves. We are like thoſe Dwarfs, that affect to ſet themſelves on high places, that they may appear the taller. And therefore men who have leſs of merit and true greatneſs, are ordinarily the moſt enamour'd of theſe falſe Grandeurs. There are ſome Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons indeed, from which Magnificence is almoſt inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable: God, who has inveſted Kings with their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, doth not think it ill, they ſhould be inveſted with Purple: and it is highly neceſſary that they ſhould be ſurrounded with a ſplendour to ſurpriſe the ſenſe, ſo as more eaſily to obtain that veneration from the heart which is due to them. This is an ordinary <hi>Illuſion</hi> of the Senſes, which makes us conſider how great that is which dazles them: but it is an Illuſion, which, in this caſe, is of ſome uſe. Where there is the true greatneſs of Quality, and Authority, an apparent grandeur may be indured; although by exceſs there may be Sin here as well as elſewhere. Great men reſemble thoſe Giants, who were not content with their natural great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but lifted their hands up towards Heaven to be ſeen afar off. Above all, this is a ſenſeleſs pleaſure, when one is little in all reſpects, to pleaſe himſelf with appearing Great, and debaſing the Purple to the Duſt, which ſhould not appear but upon or near the Throne. This is a vice of our Age, wherein I believe, we ſurpaſs all other Ages: and the corruption is gone ſo far, that it is made a duty to follow it. For ſome wiſe and pious Perſons there are, who propoſe this dangerous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime with a great deal of Confidence: That there ought no difference to be made; that every one ſhould be apparell'd according to his condition; that we are not to affect Singularity. In a word, they boldly blame thoſe Women, who profeſſing a great Devotion wear no other than very mean cloaths, at a mighty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:151353:65"/>diſtance from the Luxury of Perſons of their Rank. A very ſtrange thing this, that we ſhould be ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Piety, and have ſo much fear of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, as to fly even the Appearances thereof? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Maxime 'tis held, that Chriſtian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men be cloathed with the moſt rich and magnificent Stuffs, that they be cover'd with Gold and precious Stones, ſince all Perſons of quality go ſo. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves of theſe Vanities to do Alms, they are accus'd of being <hi>Devoto's.</hi> The miſchief, it ſeems, is without remedy, when't comes to this. The Church once believed, it did infinitely relax its ſelf, when it tolerated theſe Diſorders; but I am afraid it muſt ſhortly come to give them its Approbation. I would fain know of theſe People that maintain this Maxime, in what place they might find it? It is not in the <hi>holy Scripture;</hi> for St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly forbids Chriſtian Women the uſe of Gold and broidred hair. It is not in the Fathers; for they never ſpeak with more vigour than when they ſpeak againſt the luxury and pomp of Apparel: they call it <hi>the Pomp of the Devil.</hi> In all places they preach againſt this Vanity, and ſay that, by the Laws of Charity, we are obliged to renounce theſe ſuperfluities, to cloath the Poor, to comfort the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to uphold the Church when it ſtaggers, or is in a low condition. They ſay that Simplicity and Plainneſs of Array is a ſign of Piety and renouncing the World.</p>
               <p>But what is meant, when they ſay, <hi>we muſt make no diſtinction?</hi> muſt we be carried away by the ſtream becauſe it is a general and common evil? muſt not we labour to guard our ſelves from it? muſt no one dare to get out of the crowd of thoſe that deſtroy themſelves? for my part, I believe quite contrary, we ought to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our ſelves, if we have courage enough to do it. I would know, whether that ſovereign <hi>Moderation</hi> be not as good in Clothes as in other things: if it be good
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151353:65"/>can it be evil to give examples of it? on the other ſide, is it not glorious to march the firſt in the way of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Apparel, I know, has been always different accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diverſity of conditions. But firſt we are to obſerve, that in our age there are no People but carry a Magnificenee infinitely above their Condition. Now it hath always been accounted glorious to a man to do what he ought, according to the Eſtate wherein he is, when he his only to do his Duty. Moreover, Men did not heretofore diſtinguiſh their Condition ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as they do now adays: The difference of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt have been extreamly ſenſible and great, if it were permitted 'em to diſtinguiſh themſelves from others by Magnificence. It was not ſufficient to be rich only, or of a Birth a little elevated above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. And now if it be permitted to every one to be cloathed and have a Retinue according to his Condition, Pride and Vanity, that mark the bounds which diſtinguiſh conditions, will puſh men on to ſtrange exceſſes. 'Tis alſo good to conſider, that there's a great difference betwixt tolerating a thing as permitted, and authorizing it as neceſſary. Great Men may be ſuffer'd to diſtinguiſh themſelves from others by their Train, Equipage, and Habit, provided this does not go to the Exceſs that reigns in our Age: But never ought we to make this their Duty, nor to ſay to them, <hi>be not particular from the reſt of your Rank.</hi> On the contrary, we are to let them know, that it is glorious to them to renounce theſe unhappy Vanities, which are diſpleaſing to God. In ſhort, certain it is, that never was this Maxime more dangerous than in our Age, <hi>the keeping up one's Quality,</hi> in the <hi>ſtyle</hi> of the World: that is, to expend one's whole eſtate in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Habits, Ornaments, Equipages, and in things of that nature. When therefore any one ſays to a Gentleman, <hi>be not ſingular, doe as other perſons of your
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:151353:66"/>Quality, he certainly</hi> authorizes this unhappy prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which puts people out of a Condition to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral towards the maintenance of the Church. So that men may ſay what they will, but I will never believe that any one is endued with perfect Devotion, as long as I ſee him environed with the vain pomp of the World. One cannot have a true Devotion, unleſs he is truly humble. Now this reaſon why we ſhould make ſuch unprofitable Expences to maintain our quality in the World, draws its riſe from Pride. The true Chriſtian conſidering himſelf in himſelf and with regard had to God, knows he is nought but Duſt and Aſhes, and nothing before God: He is not ignorant that God hath no reſpect of Perſons, nor is acquainted with theſe differences of Conditions. Thus each truly devout Soul will, without doubt, renounce all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Ornaments, and ſpare all thoſe ſuperfluous expences to do good works withall.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, we are not to perſuade our ſelves, that this <hi>Inſtruction</hi> which is really that of Chriſt himſelf, brings us into a Path, that leads us to <hi>Superſtition;</hi> and that pious Perſons are obliged to apparel themſelves after a baſe and extravagant manner. 'Tis in this reſpect, we may ſay, that we are to affect nothing. But there is a vaſt diſtance between the magnificence of this Age and thoſe cloaths that render men ridiculous. I could not refuſe this ſmall <hi>Digreſſion</hi> to combat the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the age, in favour to many upright Souls, that deſire to do their Duty, but know not to what their Duty tyes them. And now I return to the Pleaſures of Imagination, wherof I began to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>Among theſe pleaſures of the Imagination, ſome we find innocent. A man, for example, may, without ſin, take a great pleaſure in the cultivating a little land: His houſe is to him the moſt ſtately Palace, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as good as the fineſt in the World. He will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:151353:66"/>himſelf perfectly, in framing and ſetting right his little <hi>Parterres,</hi> his <hi>Paliſado's,</hi> his hedge-rows of Fruit and his dwarfiſh Trees. He will gather the fruit with more acknowledgment to God's goodneſs than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs would have in taking Tributes, from all the Earth. A Father of a Family rejoyces at the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Houſe; a Woman at her work; an Artificer at the ſucceſs of his labour. Is there not real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all this? Theſe are pleaſures of Imagination, but not of a fooliſh one, which feeds its ſelf with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures; but, one that is conducted by reaſon, clarified by Grace; and judges that we ought to eſteem more what we have, than all which we have not. Theſe pleaſures, and theſe innocent errours, if I may call them ſo, are not altogether enemies to the Spirit of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, there are pleaſures of the mind, amongſt which it is eaſier to find Innocence: honeſt and civil Converſations, reading of good Books, eloquent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, the ſtudy of good Sciences and works of Wit may afford theſe Pleaſures. But many cautions are to be us'd herein. Firſt, we muſt take care leſt we confound the Wit with its impurity. Oftentimes we think we find Pleaſure in a <hi>Piece,</hi> becauſe it has Wit, and this is only, becauſe it has Impurity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There are certain Poductions of Wit, that flatter our Paſſions: Of this nature are the Compoſures of the <hi>Theatre,</hi> the ſables of <hi>Romances,</hi> and that which they call gallant Proſe and Verſe. We admire there the delicacy of Expreſſion, the Beauty of Thought, and the Strength of Imagination. Look a little nearer, and you will ſee, that the heart is incomparably more touch'd than the Mind. Theſe Productions we love, becauſe they have a ſecret Alliance with the Corruption of our Hearts, and a conformity to the Impreſſions of our vitiated Imagination. The Pleaſure that we find
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:151353:67"/>therein, comes chiefly from the impurity, which is ſo nicely and delicately diſplayed. There are ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whoſe <hi>Turpitude</hi> is ſo great, as at the firſt bluſh we dread them: When they are ſhewn us all naked, we cannot endure the ſight; nevertheleſs we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling enough to take a view of them, if they be cover'd with a thin Veil which hides their Uncleanneſs from the Senſes, and yet lets it be wholly ſeen by the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which applies it's ſelf to theſe Objects with an extream Delight: This is the Character of thoſe Works, whereof we ſpeak. We are to take care alſo, that among the innocent Pleaſures, we do not taſte that which Springs from ſinful, curious, and viſibly vain <hi>Sciences,</hi> of no more manner of uſe, and that only ſerve to fill up the Mind's Capacity and an Emptineſs of all good things. In a word, if it be permitted to taſte Pleaſure in the ſtudy of good Sciences, and uſeful and innocent Knowledges, at leaſt we ought to have a care we be not wholly taken up by them. Nothing can be innocent that becomes to us an obſtacle of Piety.</p>
               <p>This is ſufficient me thinks, to ſhew, that Devotion has not declared War to Pleaſure and Joy: In making a wiſe and prudent choice of ſuch Pleaſures, we may find them ſufficient to ſweeten the bitterneſs of Life; ſo as there will be no need of burying our ſelves alive: and keeping the Soul conſtantly mourning and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cloathing it in a black and diſmal melancholy.</p>

                  <p>HOw much indebted am I to my God. What ſhall I render unto him for his loving kindneſs, who hath made me to be placed in the midſt of ſo many good things,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:151353:67"/>and left me the Enjoyment of them? I ſhould have had no cauſe to complain if he had torn me out of this World to throw me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell. Was it not in his free-will alſo, to make even this World here to become an Hell to me, that I might be ſaved in the other World? I could not blame his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor his Juſtice, though he had put me here to continual torments; Tho he had lockt up from me all the ſources of theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; though he made all my good Days ſo many darkſome Nights. He might have left me Eyes only to pour forth Tears; Ears to hear only the ſound of Thunder and the Voice of his Judgment; Taſte, only for the bitterneſs of Gall and Worm-wood; Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, only to feel the weight of his Blows. He might have mingled Gall in all my repaſts, empoiſoned all objects, and (that I may ſo ſpeak) inveſted them with Thorns, to pierce me as they came near me. If he had done this, I muſt have ſaid, <hi>He is Juſt, and I am a Sinner:</hi> it is reaſonable, that this World being ſullied by my Sins ſhould be the Theatre of my Puniſhments; and that the Object of my Senſes, upon which my Corruption hath diſplay'd it's ſelf, become the Avengers of my Crimes. But all on the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:151353:68"/>other ſide, God, who commands me to be ſober, wiſe, temperate, moderate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the vain Pleaſures of the Fleſh and World leaves me ſtill, for all this, more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures than I deſerve: He leaves me enough to temper, and to render the ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſin ſupportable. True it is, he ſmites me ſometimes; and makes me to ſee his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Countenance. I am ſubject to mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: I may become weak and feeble; I may loſe what he has given me of good things; my honours may be taken away from me; I may be perſecuted. But when I reckon my ill and compare them with my good dayes, I find, that theſe are in a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number than them. My Pleaſures do infinitely ſurmount my Pains: If I recollect my ſickneſſes and my hours of trouble, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may ariſe to ſome Months, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſome years: But how many years of Proſperity hath my God granted me? Wretched and ungrateful, as I am, A little pain in my Finger hinders me from being ſenſible of the whole body's health: one hour of perplexity envenoms my whole life, and makes me forget all my Proſperities and all the Obligations I have to my God. But though my misfortunes were very long and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:151353:68"/>purſuing, they would not be ſtill ſo long as my life, and by conſequence, not have ſo long duration as my ſins: and therefore I ſhould have no reaſon to complain to, but rather to bleſs and praiſe my God. For if I am unhappy a few years, I am a ſinner from the very firſt moment of my Life. So that if the moments of my Afflictions were to paſs in account before God, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Juſtice for ſo many moments mark't by my ſins; Alas, my Soul! how much would'ſt thou ſtill owe to the Divine Juſtice, ſince the number of thy Calamities does not come near the number of thy Offences. The moments, wherein God hath made me to enjoy moſt of his Bleſſings, have been thoſe, wherein I have render'd my ſelf the moſt ſinful by the abuſe of my Proſperity: And the leaſt ſin I commited in one of thoſe moments, deſerves pains of an infinite du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                     <hi>ALmighty God, who makeſt all things with a profound Wiſdom, I find nothing to ſay againſt thy Works. All that thou haſt made is good: But I mourn for my Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and bewail my Corruption. Good is in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Evil; and the things which are permitted me are ſo near to thoſe that are forbidden me, that if I forget innocent Pleaſures but a little, I ſtraight paſs into ſinful
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:151353:69"/>ones. At all paſſages the Devil lies in Ambuſh, and my Concupiſcence lays ſnares for me every where; Narrow is the way, and borders on precipices. I know, Lord, that thy goodneſs is infinite, and thou doſt not exact from me that I ſhould be evermore in Grief; thou alloweſt ſome grains to the Feſh, as rebellious as 'tis againſt thee. But how difficult and dargerous is it to mark out preciſely the Bounds that diſtinguiſh permitted from forbidden Pleaſures. If I give ear to my Concupiſcence, it will ſtretch the limits far beyond all Reaſon: it will endeavour to perſuade me, that whatſoever is agreeable cannot be bad; whether I eat or drink, am aſleep or awake, am idle or at work, I am always in the Temptation and Danger of falling into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Thy Providence willeth that I paſs through all theſe Dangers: Thou alone art able to conduct me ſafely through this difficult Path: Let thy Spirit lead me as in an even Plain; Let me turn neither to the right nor to the left. Here are two Extremities to fly; thou hateſt carnal Pleaſures, but it may be thou doſt not love exceſſive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities. Bodily Exerciſe profiteth little, but Godlineſs has the promiſes of this Life and of that which is to come. I know, O my God, that 'tis much more dangerous to fall into one Exceſs than into the other. All thou ſay'ſt of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Exerciſe is, That it is profitable but to a few things: but as to the other exceſs, to wit, of Pleaſures, it hurts and incommodes all things; it makes havock of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it corrupts the Heart, ruines the Body, grieves the Holy Spirit, and it ſeparates the Soul from thee, O Lord. 'Tis incomparably more ſafe to renounce all Pleaſures in general than to chooſe ſome, and expoſe ones ſelf to the danger of taking thoſe that are unlawful. O thou, who holdeſt in thine hands the Heart of Men as the Rivers of Water, turn mine into the ſafeſt way, wherein I am certain not to offend thee; and that is the privation of all ſenſual Pleaſures. Take from me that taſte of all Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, wherewith I am inchanted. Caſt off from the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:151353:69"/>Demon of Pleaſure, that Mask which covers him, and that fading Beauty which charms me; that I may ſee all his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>glineſs and Deformity, and deteſt and fly it. Since the Body, which thou obligeſt me to hale after me, to nouriſh and conſerve, binds me to do Actions conjoyn'd with Pleaſure, give me the Grace to do thoſe Actions to ſatisfie Neceſſity, and not to ſerve Senſuality. Diſcover to me the Snares that Luſt lays for me under the Cloak of Neceſſity. Let me not by an ill habit, make that neceſſary which is ſuperfluous according to the Laws of Nature and Reaſon; that my Soul under thy guidance may keep its Body under as a Slave, and not ſerve it as its Maſter.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>'TIS obſerv'd, that for the obtaining any thing we muſt ask much more than we have a mind to get; and that to bring men to juſt Sentiments in withdrawing them from their Errours, it is good to carry them a little into the other <hi>Extremity,</hi> that in their return they may abide at leaſt in a reaſonable middle. This perhaps has made ſo many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors and Preachers to imitate the ſtyle of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> upon the Nature of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain.</hi> Theſe People ſay, that Pain is no evil; and Pleaſure is not a Good: We can ſay, they be perfectly happy in the burning Bull of <hi>Phalar is,</hi> and perfectly unhappy in taſting the greateſt Pleaſures. This method is not, it may be, ſo good, as we imagine: We ſoyle and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten mens Minds by requiring too much of them; and nothing is perſuaſive, when Truth is inveſted with <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> which awaketh curioſity, but diſtemper the Mind. After all, we can never perſuade men to the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:151353:70"/>contrary to what they feel. <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us of one of theſe Philoſophers, who had bin blinded by the pompous reaſonings of his <hi>Sect;</hi> But a great Rheum falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Eyes, which put him to horrible Tortures, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the Illuſions of his Philoſophy, and made him abandon it. When we ſee one of theſe <hi>Sages</hi> cruelly tormented upon his Bed with the Gout or Stone; and hear him ſay, <hi>Thou mayſt do as thou wilt, O Pain, but thou ſhalt never make me confeſs, thou art an evil,</hi> we cannot keep our ſelves from looking upon this as a Comedy and profound Hypocriſie: Reaſon can do nought againſt Experience, nor againſt a Senſe ſo lively as that of pain. The <hi>Martyrs,</hi> I conceive might be happy amidſt their puniſhments, becauſe they did not feel all their Pains. For I hold that their Soul by the help of Grace was ſo ſtrongly taken up with the Glory and Crown they were about to receive, that hardly any Room remain'd to them for other Sentiments. The Patience of the Faithful in their Calamities ariſes, in my Opinion, from no other cauſe, than that their Souls being fixt wholly upon God, and his Heaven the Object of their Hope, do partly unite 'emſelves from the Body, and give leſs Heed or Attention to it's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyances: Impatience, on the other ſide, is a motion of the Soul, which turns it ſelf wholly to the Body, to be abandon'd to pain, and to feel all its racks. So that I conclude, Pain is an Evil: Which is to confeſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pleaſure is a good. 'Twas my belief, I owed this Confeſſion to them, whom we would prevail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to renounce ſenſual and fleſhly Pleaſures, that by this ſincerity and plain dealing, we may render them more attentive to our Reaſons.</p>
               <p>We do not entreat them to renounce bodily. Pleaſure as an evil in its ſelf, but as a petty and ſmall good, that brings along after it, in its train, an incredible Multitude of miſchiefs; and as a good, which is unworthy of Man born for the moſt noble Pleaſures, and deſtin'd to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:151353:70"/>poſſeſſion of the greateſt Goods. What ever we do we can never rivit out of the Mind of man this Opinion; that Happineſs conſiſts in Pleaſure. I will not oppoſe this Maxime: The chiefeſt beatitude conſiſts, without doubt, in the Poſſeſſion of the chiefeſt Good, and in this Poſſeſſion the Soul taſts it's chief Pleaſure. And if we pleaſe, we may call this chief Pleaſure the chief Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man. But men are terribly chows'd herein: They are perſuaded, that the Soul is not capable of any true Pleaſure, without it be what comes from the Body. Among men generally, a ſpiritual pleaſure and a chimerical pleaſure are all one. All thoſe who make their felicity to conſiſt in Contemplation and in Actions intirely removed from thoſe, which make up carnal pleaſure, paſs in the World for <hi>viſionary wights;</hi> this Errour ſprings from the Heart and Senſes: And therefore I ſay, that in the Judgment we ought to have of pleaſures, and in the choice we ought to make thereof, we are not to conſult either our Senſes or our Heart. This miſtake, I ſay, is cauſed by the Heart and Senſes; becauſe they believe nothing agreeable, but what is agreeable to them. We judge things good or evil only according to the relation they have to the Faculties, whereunto they raiſe either pleaſure or Pain: And therefore the Heart and Senſes which are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal cannot be touch'd by ſpiritual things: They judge theſe cannot be agreeable, becauſe they are ſenſible of no Pleaſure in them: Juſt as a blind man, if he would judge according to the report of his Senſes, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly he would judge, that there are no colours; or if there were, they could not make any Impreſſion upon his Senſes. This is then an <hi>Impoſture</hi> which we muſt lay open and diſperſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, we ought to remember, that Man is made up of two parts, the Soul and Body: Each of theſe parts hath it's ſeparate and diſtinct <hi>Goods.</hi> The Goods of the Mind are ſpiritual, and thoſe of the Body
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:151353:71"/>neceſſarily corporeal. Of theſe two parts the Soul is infinitely the more excellent. From this, Man is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly denominated, and the Body is but a Retainer to him; ſo that conſequently, the Goods and Pleaſures which belong to the Soul <hi>by its ſelf,</hi> are infinitely great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than thoſe which come by the interpoſition of the Body. Laſtly, 'tis very eaſie to comprehend why the Senſes and the Heart indge otherwiſe: Theſe being bodily Faculties, we need not wonder they hold clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for bodily things. As for the Senſes, this is without diſpute, they are corporeal, both in their Organs and in their Operations: they perceive only the Superficies of Bodies. This is no leſs true of the Heart, it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal too; for I underſtand by the Heart, the ſeat of the Paſſions, and the Imagination: 'tis very evident, that both theſe Faculties are bodily Faculties. For the Imagination is the feat wherein are repreſented thoſe Images that come from the Senſes and offer themſelves to our Mind in the abſence of Objects. The Paſſions alſo are corporeal, becauſe they are formed by <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Movements:</hi> This is manifeſt by thoſe Characters they impreſs upon the Body, as the motion of the Blood, quick, ſlow, or precipitate; Paleneſs or Ruddineſs of Complexion; the Fire and languiſhing, which they impreſs upon the eyes. The Senſes and Heart, which are corporeal, being the Gates whereat Objects do enter and accoſt the mind, bring nothing to it but bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Images, and raiſe in it only ſenſual Pleaſures; and the Soul hereby gets an habit of believing there are no other Pleaſures beſides theſe, ſince it does not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſingage it ſelf from the Body, and to taſte others. But can it be poſſible we ſhould be ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our ſelves, and ſo irrational, as to believe our Senſes touching a thing of ſo great Importance? The Senſes are unable to know the thouſandth part of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. As ſoon as ever a Body ceaſes to have a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Extenſion, we ceaſe to ſee and feel it; and would
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:151353:71"/>we make theſe very Senſes to be judges of things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Spiritual? Certainly, the Soul is very unhappy and very much a Slave, if it cannot taſte that Pleaſure which is its ſovereign Felicity, but it muſt be beholden to the Body for it. If <hi>Matter</hi> be the Spring of true Pleaſure, what do thoſe Souls do, I wonder, that are ſeparated from Matter? what muſt be the Beatitude of Angels, that have no Body? Is it not true, that their Pleaſures ought to be as far above ours, as Minds are above Matter? Aſſuredly, ſpiritual Pleaſures ſpring from the knowledge of Truth, from the practiſe of Virtue, from our union with God by the tyes of Love, and from that Action, whereby God unites himſelf immediately to our Soul. All this is intirely above the Senſes: they are not acquainted with Truth; for their Office is to report the Appearances of Bodies: They cannot judge of Virtue; it is not under their Juriſdiction: much leſs can they judge of that Union betwixt God and the Soul. And yet, although they make no report to us about any of theſe things, we are not nevertheleſs to doubt of the real Impreſſions they make upon our Souls.</p>
               <p>But, from whence comes it, <hi>ſay ſome,</hi> that ſpiritual Pleaſures are not ſo touching and make not ſuch ſtrong Impreſſions upon the Soul, as bodily ones doe? For you ſee not, <hi>ſay they,</hi> your devout People in thoſe Tranſports of Joy and Pleaſure, as we ſee men have in the injoyment of Senſual Pleaſures. Is not this a proof that thoſe intellectual pleaſures are merely imaginary, or at leaſt that they are very weak and languiſhing. This difficulty ariſes from that men know not how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Soul from the body: they believe it is concern'd in proportion to the greatneſs of the agitations of the Bodily Organs: They are perſuaded, that it cannot receive an impreſſion of Joy, but by the interpoſal of theſe great corporeal motions. But the thing is far otherwiſe: 'tis certain, that in the great Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which the Soul receives from the Body, the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:151353:72"/>great corporeal Agitations re'ncounter one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it receives not thoſe pleaſures but by favour of theſe agitations, and becauſe the Bloud and Spirits are in a great heat and ferment: But the Pleaſures of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſons, which are lock'd up in the Soul it ſelf, and which exert no external Characters, do not fail to make very powerful Impreſſion. Theſe Pleaſures are ſo great and ſo touching, that they carry the Soul out of the World: And the Joy, which ſprings from the poſſeſſion of God, from the Knowledge of his Truth, and the imitation of his Vertues and Attributes, muſt needs infinitely tranſcend all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Body: Since that for theſe ſpiritual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, we not only renounce bodily ones, but alſo expoſe our ſelves to all, even the moſt ſenſible pains. True it is, the more the Soul is accuſtomed to let its ſelf be moved by the Agitations, which do cauſe corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Pleaſures and Paſſions, the more is it uncapable of taſting Internal joys and ſpiritual Pleaſures. And this is one of the greateſt miſchiefs that ſpring from the continual uſe of ſenſuality: the Soul waxeth fat, as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh: the heart of the Wicked is fat as greaſe; he hath prophaned the Rock of his Salvation. It covers its ſelf, as it were, with fleſh and bloud, and taſtes nothing, but what flatters this Fleſh and Bloud. And therefore among ſenſual Pleaſures, there are permitted our Devout Perſon only thoſe which are moderate. The Senſes love to receive ſtrong impreſſions of Objects, provided there be no wound in the caſe; the imagination loves alſo to be powerfully moved: But all theſe emotions make ſuch mighty impreſſions upon the Soul, as it hardly can come to it ſelf again: And therefore they ought carefully to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
               <p>But if we would have more ſenſible proofs, that the heart, the paſſions and the ſenſes are not to be conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:151353:72"/>about the choice of Pleaſures; let us hear experience, and caſt an eye upon the diſorders of the world. Such are, the conſequences of this blindneſs in men, who follow their own heart and ſenſes in the choice of Goods and Pleaſures. Why did the firſt Woman lay hold on the forbidden fruit? becauſe it was good and pleaſant to the eye, ſhe hearkened to her Heart and Senſes. How did corruption ariſe to that high pitch in the World, that it forced God's Juſtice to bring upon it a terrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuge? Becauſe the Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of men that they were fair: they ſtopt their Ears to the voice of God, which call'd upon them; they heark'ned to the ſollicitations of their own ſenſual heart: they took them Wives, of all which they choſe, and corrupted themſelves with them. Did not <hi>David</hi> commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and Murder in a little time, becauſe he gave ear to his ſenſes and heart, and let his paſſions ſeduce him? did not <hi>Solomon</hi> become an Idolater, becauſe his ſinful love for Women having blinded his eyes, ſeparated him from God, and ſtopt the Ears of his Soul: ſo as his mind heard only the voice of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and his Senſes? Laſtly, did not St. <hi>Peter</hi> deny his Lord and Maſter; for that his heart, his ſenſes, his imagination made him ſee preſent Death in an affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poſture, and he conſulted neither God nor his own reaſon?</p>
               <p>We ſeem here to blend and confound Innocence with Sin, in ſpeaking of our Heart and our Senſes, as common Sources of our errours: Since that the Senſes may ſeem rather to be unhappy and unfortunate than Criminal and Sinful. True, the Senſes are ſubject to two unhappineſſes. The firſt is to be forced to receive Objects which are ſinful, and capable of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Images of corruption to the Heart; ſuch are evil Examples, ſcandalous Actions and Words. The other misfortune of the Senſes is, that they take in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:151353:73"/>Objects, and ſometimes in an innocent manner; and theſe Images do ſpoyl and corrupt themſelves in the Heart. Nevertheleſs, I think we ought not to ſeparate the Senſes from the Heart, they make but one and the ſame thing. This is a Match at the end of which lies a great heap of Gun-powder. The Hear and the Imagination are the inward extremity of this Match; they are the Magazine of Powder: The Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are the other end, to which the Objects ſet fire. This Fire ſlides, or rather it flies along the Match: It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindles the Imagination, and puts the Heart into a flame: And therefore the holy Spirit puts for the ſame thing, <hi>To walk in the ways of ones heart, and in the ſight of ones Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, if we would be perfectly aſſured that our Heart and Senſes are evil Counſellors in this affair, hear what the holy Scripture ſaith; it conſiders our Heart as the root of all our Evils. <hi>Every imagination of the thoughts of Man's heart is only evil continually. The Heart is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked; who can know it? Out of the Heart proceed evil Thoughts, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, falſe Witneſs, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies: Theſe are the things which defile a Man.</hi> The holy Ghoſt repreſents the Heart to us, as blind, wrapt up in a thick Cloud and profound darkneſs: it ſpeaks of it, as of a kind of Death, it is of the Earth, it is carnal. How then canan Heart thus compoſed and fram'd judge of the true Goods and Pleaſures? How can there come any thing good from a poyſoned Spring. And thus we ſee that the Wife man puts this Maxime among the members of thoſe we are to deteſt and abominate, <hi>Walk in the ways of thine Heart and in the ſight of thine Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould end here, were it unneceſſary to take off one Scandal that may be taken at what we have ſaid, that ſenſual Pleaſure is a <hi>Good,</hi> and even a Good for the Soul: For, in a word, if the Soul, be that not only
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151353:73"/>which perceives, and which taſtes Pleaſure, and if Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be a Good, 'tis a Good of the Soul. If it be a good, then ſome will ſay, we are to ſeek and love it. It's not ſufficient to anſwer that this is a Good of the Body only, that is not abſolutly true: 'tis, in ſome ſort the good of the Soul, becauſe the Soul taſtes it. Further, if this Good were only for the Body, yet it does not follow, it ſhould therefore be of neceſſity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; ſince we are not always forbidden to ſeek the Good of the Body. But we ought not only to conſider a thing in its ſelf, to know whether it be good or bad; we muſt conſider it in its cauſes and its effects, in what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes it, what may be the conſequence of it. I mean, that the Pleaſure which comes to the Soul by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is a ſort of Good conſidered in it ſelf. Look upon its Source, and ſee to what it produces. The Source is Sin, is Impurity, is Rebellion againſt the law of our Creator. What it produces is a diſunion between God and our Soul: 'tis a pawning our ſelves to Death, 'tis the pain of everlaſting burnings. How can we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Good conceive a thing which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſt about by ſo many moral Impurities and ſuch real Miſchiefs? If therefore, bodily Pleaſure can be called a Good with reſpect to the preſent ſentiment of the Soul, it's an Evil in all other regards; it's an Evil to ſpeak Abſolutely: and therefore the wifeſt men of all Ages, have plac'd it among the falſe Goods: for a true Good ought to be good on every ſide we view it.</p>
               <p>The Soul then has no true Pleaſure but what ariſes from its union with God. And this union is fortified according to the meaſure that we looſen our ſelves from ſenſible things, and are united to God by the knowledge of his Truth: Not of thoſe Verities which Philoſophy ſeeks after, and never finds with any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but of thoſe Divine truths which Faith diſcovers to us of thoſe wholſome Verities, which are the Candle
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151353:74"/>of the Soul. <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp to my Feet, and a light to my Paths. It enlightens the Eyes and makes wiſe the ſimple.</hi> The ſecond Bond, whereby we are united to God, is <hi>Virtue;</hi> the Practice of which renders us like to our Creator; renews his Image in us, and makes us to be the Copies of that Beauty whereof he's the original. the third cord is the love, with which we love God, and that by which we are beloved of him. By this Love he is in us, and we are in him; becauſe Love makes a transfuſion of Hearts, and the Soul is more in the <hi>Subject,</hi> which it loves, than in that which it ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. As to the pleaſures which ſpring from this u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it is of the number of thoſe things, which cannot be conceiv'd without they be felt. 'Tis ſuch, that all the Pleaſures of the World appear unſavoury, to them that taſte it. 'Tis ſo great as it hath often made the Saints to fall down, who have been extraordinarily touch'd with its holy Extaſies and Raviſhments, which ſeem'd to have entirely broke the Alliance betwixt the Body and the Soul. Now without queſtion it is, that Devotion contributes and leads to this Pleaſure. It di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes our union with ſenſual things; diſunites us from our Body; lifts us up to God; purifies our Souls in drawing nigh to him; makes them partake of the Beams of that great Sun of righteouſneſs; and renders them as ſo many little Gods, by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Glory of our great God.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>That young People have no Priviledge to uſe ſenſual Pleaſures, nor to diſpence themſelves from Devotion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ONE Reflection is ſtill behind, which we are obliged to make before we leave this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Subject; we having done nothing yet in regard to young People. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade 'emſelves, it may be, that whatever hath bin ſay'd does not concern them: it is almoſt impoſſible to deliver them from this Errour, That Pleaſure is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly their ſhare, and that, without Tyranny, we cannot deny it them. To them Indevotion is natural, and they reckon it a particular Honour. We ſhould make fine work of it (ſay they) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Bigots</hi> at theſe years, they fancy that Modeſty, Wiſdom, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and Temperance, are not proper for them; 'tis the buſineſs of old Men, ſay they, we muſt not make our ſelves ridiculous by turning <hi>Cato</hi>'s and <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>'s. And indeed if any one of them has more happy Inclinations, he is aſham'd, he diſſembles 'em, he follows the Crowd. They tell him, <hi>to every thing under the Heaven there is a time.</hi> In conſidering old and young men, we can never believe, ſay they, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo different are deſtin'd to the ſame Actions: The wrinkled forehead of old Age, the paleneſs of it's Complexion, hollow Eyes, chap-fallen Mouth, and Limbs all trembling, have a correſpondence with the Duties of Repentance, and it's fit that they pour forth Tears and give themſelves up to Mortification. But the good diſpoſition and plumpneſs of Youth, that flouriſh of Blood, that diſplays it's ſelf upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, lively and ſparkling Eyes, Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſes eager and capable to be toucht by their Objects very manifeſtly ſhew, that this age is born for pleaſures and all manner
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:151353:78"/>of Joy. Thus it is, they flatter and hug themſelves in their ſecurity. Not only young People talk at this rate, but moſt part of mankind agree with them in it. I cannot deny, but that the extravagancies and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of conduct in the life of an old man impreſs much greater marks of infamy, than the debauches of the younger ſort. I muſt confeſs alſo, that the diſorders of old age diſcover a greater depth of Corruption. It cannot caſt it's faults upon the firſt boylings of the Blood, which hath much filth and ſcum: It cannot take the default of Experience for excuſe, and, in ſhort, it breaks the barriers of a ſhame much greater than that which follows the crimes of Youth. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, God will not judge men according to humane Rules and the Sentiments of the World: there is no Age, that has receiv'd a diſpenſation from obeying God. All the violaters of his Law ſhall be puniſht, ſince his Commandments are given to all; and if ſo be the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Age put a diverſity in ſins in reſpect of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, this would only in the upſhot go upon the More and the Leſs: But what will that reſult to; ſeeing, in a word, even the leſs unhappy muſt have their ſhare in Eternal fires, and the Worm that never dyeth?</p>
               <p>Why ſhould young people be leſs obliged to Devotion? Has God given them leſs? On the contrary, they, as well as old men, have received of God their Being and Reaſon: but farther, they have vigour of Body, force of Wit, Health, Youth, and the flower of Age. Aſſuredly, theſe are particular Obligations to devote themſelves to God All theſe advantages they have not receiv'd to conſecrate them to the Devil of Luſt and Voluptuouſneſs. Is any thing too good for God? They deſign for him a tatter'd body, 'putrified Lungs, gloomy Eyes, and dry Members. In truth, God will be mightily oblig'd to them: they would give him the bottom Lees of their years, and conſecrate
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:151353:78"/>to him that Age which is the ſink of Life, and the Center of all Miſeries: that is to ſay, they would give him, what the World has caſt off: they act like cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous men, who are only liberal when they are dying: they give what they can retain no more. Believe me, all the very beſt we have is not goo good for our God. Heretofore he would not have <hi>Victimes</hi> that had any fault, that were ill or in no good caſe, or that had loſt any part of the Body. Do we believe he will be pleas'd to accept the Sacrifices of a ſpent and waſted heart, and a man, who is only the ſhadow of what he was once? <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>exhort you, that ye preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice.</hi> But young People, that take up the reſolution of being devout, when they can be no longer ſinners, promiſe God their dead and (as it were corrupted) Bodies: for in old age, Bodies are like Phantoms, and come near to the nature of Carkaſſes. God has thought nothing too good for us; he has given himſelf for us; he who is the ſovereign good, has given us his Son: he devoted him to death for us in the flower of his age; and it is juſt that we be devoted to his ſervice in all our Ages.</p>
               <p>God is not ſatisfied with theſe promiſes of futurity, <hi>I will give thee.</hi> He would have us ſpeak in the preſent tenſe, I do give thee; as he does himſelf in ſpeaking to us, <hi>I give you my Peace.</hi> He is called, He who is, was, and is to come: So that to him appertain all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of time, the paſt, preſent, future: but among theſe he loves the preſent time, and he ſays, <hi>I am what I am,</hi> or, he who is, and not, he who ſhall be. He that would be like God, and pleaſe him, muſt ſpeak as he does: I am he that is righteous, holy, ſeparate from ſinners, devoted to God, conſecrated to his Service.</p>
               <p>Heretofore God required our firſt-ſruits, and the firſt born of our Herds, and likewiſe of our Children. <hi>Abraham</hi> roſe betimes in the morning to go and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151353:79"/>his Son, and God commanded that an immortal Fire ſhould burn in his Temple for the perpetual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Morning as well as Evening. This ſignifies, God would be ſerved firſt, and our <hi>Firſts</hi> are to be conſecrated to him; he wills not we ſhould ſay to him, <hi>Come and follow me,</hi> if the World leaves any thing remaining thou ſhalt have it. He loves not thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſay unto him, Let us firſt do ſuch a thing, or go to ſuch a place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He anſwers them, Let the dead bury their dead, come ye and follow me. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put your hands to the Plough, if ye look back ye are not fit for the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>Few perſons there are but confeſs, That one time or other in ones Life it is neceſſary to think on God; They only diſpute about the time. One ſays, I will become a good Chriſtian when I have finiſh'd my Houſe; another, when I have made my Fortune; and young People ſay, when we are old and have taſted the pleaſures of Life: in a word, All remit this great Affair to Futurity. Since they confeſs that 'tis of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to give up themſelves to God, and that without this, Hell and Death eternal are inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; is it not the greateſt Fury and Madneſs to deal thus, and to remit an Affair of ſo great Importance to the time to come, whereof we can in no wiſe be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Young People, you Idolaters of Pleaſure, make uſe of the Example of the rich man, who ſaid in the Evening to his Soul, Eat, drink, and be merry, thou haſt laid up Goods for many years; when that very Night, that Soul to which he had given ſuch bad Counſel, was required of him. Who has given you Aſſurances that you ſhall arrive to old Age? Or have ye made a Treaty with God, that in what Eſtate ſoever Death ſhall ſurpriſe you Heaven ſhall receive you. If Death re'ncounters you, cover'd with Vices, coming from a Comedy at the Theatre, or from a Debauch at the Tipling-houſe, or any place more infamous, Do
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:151353:79"/>ye believe ye are in a good Condition to ſay at the Gate of Heaven, Lord, Lord, open unto us? It will be anſwer'd, Go, I know you not, ye Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: Ye will ſay, without doubt, We have ſinned againſt Heaven and againſt thee, we are not worthy to be called thy Sons; but ſpare us, and impute all our Sins to our Youth. This will do nothing; God cannot in favour of Youth diſannul that irrevocable Edict, Nothing impure can enter into my Holy City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, who frequently happen to ſay very good things, ſay, Remember thy God, and turn to him only one day before thy Death. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily well ſaid: think therefore of thy God to day, for to morrow perhaps thou ſhalt dye. What do we do then when we diſpoſe of the time to come, and ſay, To morrow we will ſet upon ſuch a ſort of Pleaſure, the day after we will act a Debauch, we will live in this manner for fifty or ſixty years, and after that we will think of a Retreat to God? Truly, we imitate thoſe ambitious and viſionary Princes, who, upon the only hope of making Conqueſts, divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand the Provinces, and diſpoſe of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are none of their own. To whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the time to come? Without doubt, to God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who holds it as in Store-houſes, and lets it run as pleaſeth him, who ſtops its Source, or prolongs its Current: ſo that when we diſtribute the time to come, we take upon us to beſtow what is Gods and none of our own, and which perhaps never will be; and yet we deſtine and divide it before-hand to ſundry uſes. And this is the utmoſt Folly, even in the opinion of the World, and noted by many Proverbs that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known.</p>
               <p>Since therefore it is abſolutely neceſſary to devote our ſelves to God, is it not to be done when it is moſt eaſie? And I maintain, it's eaſier to love God and be converted to him when we are young, than in old
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151353:80"/>Age. This ſeems to be a Paradox, becauſe in that Age the Blood boils, the Fleſh is vigorous, and Sin ſticks to the Entrails. We have a peculiar and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign taſte in all worldly Pleaſures. True indeed; when once we have let the Reins looſe to Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in our Youth, it is well nigh impoſſible to ſtop its impetuous Paſſion and Fury. It ought to dry up the Springs, that it may put an end to theſe Diſorders. But if in good time we turn our Souls to God, and to Devotion, it is ſure, we ſhall improve therein incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably much better than in old Age: to what thing oever young Men are carried, they are carried to it with Violence and Ardour. 'Tis the Temper of that Age; if there be a good Conduct made of thoſe firſt F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, there will thence ariſe an excellent <hi>Zeal,</hi> and an holy fervour of Devotion, as we ſee in them who know how to make a right uſe, and ſerve themſelves of the Rapidneſs of Torrents and Rivers, to turn Mills and Machines of great advantage to the Life of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. On the contrary, Experience teaches us, that Devotion relents and ſlackens with Age, and old men are more put to it to chaſen and heat their Hearts in pious Duties: their Soul is hard'ned, 'tis not touch'd nor moved with ſo much eaſe, becauſe it is not ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as it was, the fire of Zeal ſeeming to be diminiſh'd by the diminution of natural heat.</p>
               <p>Whence come the Difficulties we meet withal in the work of Converſion? Certainly, none of them there are but what augment and encreaſe with Age. This difficulty of thinking on God proceeds from Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Habit. Now Cuſtom by Age becomes a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: it comes from the Devil; and when once it has eſtabliſh'd its Tyranny by a long <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> 'tis almoſt impoſſible to deſtroy it. At firſt it comes alone by it ſelf, but in a little while it is call'd <hi>Legion,</hi> and ſuch a Devil as cannot be conjur'd out by a <hi>Get thee behind me</hi> Satan, and cannot be chaſed away but by Prayer
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151353:80"/>and Faſting. Again, our Faculties are us'd to it, and the Soul loſes its ſtrength, it is no longer capable of a Deſign and Enterprize ſo vigorous, as to turn to God and break with Sin. In ſhort, this Difficulty proceeds from that God leaves off calling upon, and inviting and offering his Grace; and his Patience is changed into a juſt Fury and Indignation when it has been a long time abus'd.</p>
               <p>But above all, let us conſider how ſtrong the Habits of Luxury and Debauchery do become when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to take Root, and let 'em arrive even to old Age. The young Plant which might be pluck'd up with one hand, is now a trunck of immenſe Greatneſs, which reſiſts the Hatchet and Wedge. This little Monſter, the love of Voluptuouſneſs, which might have been eaſily ſtifled at its Birth, is become ſo great and ſo terrible, as there is now no attacking nor fighting with it. Sins ſimply conſidered, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſtrong by Age, their number is multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Theſe are Snow-Balls, that wax bigger and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in rowling: theſe are Torrents, which ſwell big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the farther they remove from their Spring-head: 'twas an eaſie matter at firſt to paſs over them on foot, but now one cannot croſs them by ſwimming. Now the number of multiplied Sins augments the difficulty of Devotion and Converſion. We read in the Life of the Holy Fathers, That an Angel made one of thoſe ſolitary Inhabitants of the Deſart to ſee in a Viſion an old Man, that cut Wood in the Foreſt, to get a Burthen for his Back, with deſign to carry them away. When the Fardle was extreamly big he eſſay'd to lift it up upon himſelf; but finding it too heavy, he let it fall to the ground, and fell a cutting new Wood, and added it to his Burthen; whereupon, he endeavoured again to lift it up, but that was more impoſſible for him than before. Nevertheleſs, it tumbling down again he put more Wood to it ſtill: and this he did ſeveral
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:151353:81"/>times. The ſolitary Perſon admir'd the Folly of this old Man, till the Angel took up his Speech, and ſaid, Thou ſee'ſt this old Man, he is the Emblem of World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, they heap Sins upon Sins; a deſign of lifting themſelves up to God comes acroſs; preſently they ſink under the burthen of their Sins: They begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to commit new Crimes, as if this burthen by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing would become much lighter. When they have puſh'd on their Exceſſes a good way, a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of devoting themſelves to God overtakes them, but the burthen of their Sins is become very great, and conſequently the motions of Elevation are the more difficult. This <hi>Parable</hi> was compoſed for our Subject, and againſt thoſe unhappy People that dedicate their youthful years to the Pleaſures of the World, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the practiſe of Devotion, and the lifting up of their Souls to God to another time.</p>
               <p>St <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in expounding the Hiſtory of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Reſurrection, asks, why our Lord employs Sighs, Tears, Prayers, and a loud voice to raiſe him again from the dead, which he did not do for the others, whom he reviv'd? as for the young man of <hi>Naim,</hi> whoſe biere he toucht only, and <hi>Jairus</hi>'s Daughter, to whom he only ſaid, <hi>Talitha Cumi,</hi> Maid, ariſe. 'Tis ſays he, becauſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> had been dead four days. Our Lord would give us an Image of the Difficulty to be met withall in a ſmners Converſion, when he is confirm'd in his ſin. The firſt day, ſays that Father, is that of Pleaſure which we taſte in the ſin. The ſecond is that of Conſent. The third is that of Love and Application to the pleaſure of the ſin: and the fourth is mere Cuſtom and Habit. When we are come to this, we cannot be raiſed again, we cannot be converted to God but by Cries and Tears, and the Voice of the Lord fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal in Miracles. This, methinks, makes us comprehend well the intereſt we have to think on God in due time, and to conſecrate our Youth to Devotion. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:151353:81"/>know very well, that the end obtains the Crown, but I know too, that 'tis of the higheſt importance to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin well, that we may end happily. An Arrow which wanders and ſlides from towards the Butt, juſt as it parts from the Bow, will be found at a monſtrous diſtance from the Butt before it comes to its journeys end. One, that in his youth is plung'd into debauchery, and abandons himſelf to ſenſual pleaſures, will find himſelf far remov'd from God in his old age, he muſt take a great deal of trouble to bring himſelf back again from ſuch an Aloof. And therefore, I conclude with the wiſe man, <hi>Young man, Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth.</hi>

This is too ſoon, ſay'ſt thou, to begin, and will it not be time enough ſome years hence? Wicked and ungrateful, canſt thou think too ſoon on thy God.? It is juſt, thou ſhouldſt think of him aſſoon as thou beginneſt to be, and to know thy ſelf, ſince he thought on thee and thy Salvation from Eternity. His Eſſence had no beginning, and his Love for thee had none too; Both Eternal. What didſt thou do to this great God to engage him to love
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151353:82"/>thee ſo long a while before? He lov'd thee before thou waſt amiable. He ſaw thee in thy Nothing, and in the Abyſſe of thy Corruption, and from all Eternity he prepared means for thee to get out of that Abyſſe, he prepared thee a Redeemer. He did not reſerve one moment in Eternity which he has not given thee; and thou would'ſt retrench from him many years of this ſhort and uncertain Life, whereof thou haſt the uſe here below. Perhaps thou wilt ſay, that it would not be unjuſt if thy time were divided betwixt thy God and thee, and that it is hard to give all one hath, without reſerving any thing to ones ſelf. But doſt not thou conſider, that thy God has given thee all things? He has given thee the Heaven and the Earth, the Fields, Rivers, Fountains, Plants, Trees, and Fruits; hath he reſerv'd any thing to himſelf? Has not he given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too entirely to thee? has he not given thee his only Son; and ſtill, has not he given him up to Death it ſelf for thee? wouldſt not thou then be very ungrateful, O my ſoul, if thou wouldſt divide with God, and rob him of any thing which thou haſt? But alas, when thou thinkeſt and ſpeakeſt thus, thou doſt not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thy own intereſts. Thou ſuppoſeſt, that thou loſeſt from thy ſelf all the time thou giveſt to thy God, whereas, on the other ſide, thou ſaveſt only thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from ſhip-wrack, which thou conſecrateſt to him: All the reſt of thy time is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Do not therefore hang in ſuſpence any longer, O my Soul; delay no more to renounce all the pleaſures and all the hopes of the <hi>Age,</hi> for to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy God only. In him is the Well of Life; in his Light thou ſhalt ſee Light: thou ſhalt be fatted

Thy days ſhall not riſe up in Judgment againſt thee to condemn thee, when thou ſhalt be old and on the brink of Death: The thought of thy God ſhall not put thee into an affright; Thou wilt not look upon him as a Judge, who comes to demand an account of ſo many years conſumed in vain Pleaſures, but a Deliverer who will come to break thy Irons, and as a Rewarder bringing days of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtead of painful and dolorous years which the World would make thee paſs thorough.</p>

                  <p>O <hi>Moſt gracious and merciful Lord, thou Guide of my Youth, thou Light to the blind, thou Inſtructer of the ignorant, who enlighteneſt the ſimple, bringeſt back thoſe that have wandered into the way of Truth, and perfecteſt praiſe out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings, teach me thy ways, and draw me out of the paths of the World: make haſte, that I may do ſo too: leave me not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the World and in Sin. By the effuſion of thy Grace into my Soul, make my Heart to deſire thee, that in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thee it may ſeek thee, and in ſeeking thee it may find thee, in finding thee it may love thee, and in loving thee it may find in that love a ſovereign Joy. It is now too long a time; I have conſumed my ſelf in my vain deſires. I would go to thee, but I find not ſtrength to vanquiſh thoſe Habits wherein I am engaged by Cuſtom. Come therefore and tear me, O my God, out of the arms of Voluptuouſneſs; ſuffer not theſe delays of mine: and if I ſhould ſay, yet a little while, ſtay a little longer, draw me by thy Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Word, and ſay unto me, Awaken thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light. If words be not efficacious enough to raiſe me up, touch the biere, ſtrike the Body, wherein the Soul is, as it were, buried: It ſleepeth in its Tomb, or rather it is dead: bodily Pleaſures have overwhelm'd or ſlain it. Smite therefore
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151353:83"/>the Body, that the Soul may awake; for it is better that I enter into Life having but one eye, than having two eyes to be caſt into Hell-fire: It is better that my Fleſh here below ſuffer ſome pains, and that my Soul one day taſte thoſe infinite Pleaſures which thou prepareſt for it on high. I abide in</hi> Sodom, <hi>and I love my abode: thou ſendeſt thy Angels to draw me thence, thy Word and thy Mniſters to make me depart before the terrible day comes, in which thou wilt tumble down torrents of fire and brimſtone upon this wicked World: but I ever find pretexts to delay. Lay hold then of my hand, and draw me out by the force of thy Grace, that I periſh not among the wicked. Shew me the way of thy holy hill, that I may ſave my ſelf, and thence without danger behold the deluges of Corruption, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the Country, and the Torrents of thy Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which ſuddenly and amazingly overwhelm the World. Alas! If it would pleaſe thee, O my God, to make me taſte the ſperitual Delights of thy Love, I ſhould not be ſo ſenſible of Earthly Pleaſures, and I ſhould not linger ſo long to ſeek thee, for I moſt ardently wiſh after happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: If therefore I knew that my Beatitude lyes in thee, I ſhould flye to find in thee that happineſs which I ſeek. O Lord, ſince Pleaſure is the only Load-ſtone capable of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Soul, make me taſte a little of that Joy which I ought to find in thee; make me to feel thy infinite Goodneſs, that without delay I may run after thee, and conſecrate my ſelf to thy ſervice, walking in Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs all the dayes of my Life, and ſetting my Affections on things above, that when Chriſt, who is my Life and Pleaſure, ſhall appear, I may alſo appear with him in Glory.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>WE have ſeen from how many Sources Indevotion ſprings; let us now try to vanquiſh thoſe Difficulties, by ſome Advices that may lead us to Devotion. Thoſe Advices I would give here, are either general or particular. But before I paſs further, we are to preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he whom we would make devout muſt have a Mind himſelf to become ſo: he that has not this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition will very unprofitably paſs farther. How many indevout perſons have we in the World, that do not deſire Devotion for themſelves, and contemn it in others? Of this ſort we find ſome that are ſo hardy as to perſwade themſelves they have a Religion. I am, it may be, ſays one, as religious as another, though I laugh at Devotion and devout Perſons. If they believe what they ſay, moſt aſſuredly they cheat their own Heart; and we muſt confeſs, that theſe People are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally profane. Others there are that eſteem Devotion in another, and yet like it not for themſelves: it doth not fit right with the Spirit of the World, which they make their <hi>Idol.</hi> They approve the better ſide, they admire it, but they fancy, as to their own particular, they may be ſaved with leſs Trouble. I know not whether theſe be better than the former; yet they are a little nearer to the Diſpoſition we ſeek after: but ſtill, alas! in how bad a Condition is their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151353:84"/>They are in this worſe than the former, that they ſin againſt their own Sentiment; they know their Maſters Will, and do it not. They are afraid of doing too much; provided they be ſav'd, it's of no great Importance how. What a thought is this! Is not Paradiſe worth the purchaſing at the Expence of ſome Tears, ſome Prayers, ſome hours of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And how can we imagine we can obtain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the leſs, ſince we ſhall find a hard Taſk to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive thither by the greater? <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly and the Sinner appear?</hi> Do ye believe, ye backward and lukewarm Souls, that a truly devout Perſon has too much Righteouſneſs to open to himſelf the gate of Heaven? Do not you know that all the World praiſes that Saying of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Woe to the moſt praiſe-worthy Life, if it be examined without Mercy;</hi> and what the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſays, <hi>If thou ſhould'st mark Iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> I ſpeak of the Iniquities of the Righteous. If thoſe truly devout Perſons have not over-much Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you will ſtrangely want it then who come ſo much behind them: but ye ſay, God will ſupply what is lacking; for this did Chriſt Jeſus dye, that we might obtain his Grace and Favour in the midſt of our Infirmities. But how do ye know that the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> would this, does not he do what-liketh him beſt with his own? You ought therefore to take the ſurer ſide. What aſſurance have ye that God gives his Grace thus to thoſe that ſlight it? Although you could do it, the mercy of the Lord will have employ enough; and your righteouſneſs, though puſht on to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of your ſtrength, will ſtill have need of Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to attain to Glory.</p>
               <p>There are other Indevout People, which are ſtill a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther off than the former. They would have a good deal of Devotion, but they are not yet come to deſire it; that is to ſay, the motions of their Will towards it are
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:151353:84"/>very imperfect. I would willingly become ſo (ſays one) but I cannot; the World bears me away, my Affairs wholly take me up, the temper and frame of my Body and Soul have not the neceſſary Turn for the practiſe of this Virtue; I do what I would not, and what I would that do I not; for the law of my members continues Miſtreſs of the Law of my mind: they are not much afflicted at the not having that which they wiſh, and it is a certain proof that they wiſh it very feebly. In this Eſtate, how far from Perfection muſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience needs be! This is not to love God with all the Soul; this is to ſeek him with the leaſt part of the heart, and to deſire him with a moſt imperfect Will. To will Devotion at that rate is, to take the way never to obtain it: for the Soul does not ſurmount the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties but by heartning it ſelf againſt them, and by acting with all its might and vigour. Judge then, if an Heart in this looſeneſs can attain one of the moſt difficult things in the World. We have ſeen how many ſtrong Paſſions ruine and deſtroy Devotion; the Love of the World, its Pleaſures, and its Vexations. If to theſe paſſions, ſo violent and head-ſtrong, you oppoſe, I know not what imperfect deſires it is but the Fight of Dwarfs againſt Gyants.</p>
               <p>So that the firſt general Counſel I give to attain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>otion, is, to deſire it ardently. Some will ſay, that they who deſire it, have it already: but that is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary concluſion. Some motions there are, whereof we are not the Maſters, and oftentimes we paſſionately deſire a thing we are not able to effect, although it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our Will. Moſt terrible is the tyranny of Habits, and the cord of Sin are difficult to break. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> moſt divinely paints out to us the motion of ſuch a Soul, as would elevate it ſelf to God but cannot; <q>I panted after the liberty of thinking only on thee, O my God, but I ſighed, being ſtill tyed up, not by foreign Chains, but by thoſe of my own will, which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:151353:85"/>were harder than Iron. The Devil held it in his Power; he had bound it faſt. I had a Will to ſerve thee with the pureſt Love, and to enjoy thee, O my God, in whom alone is to be found a ſolid and true Joy; but this new Will, which was but ſtill-born, was not capable of conquering that other which had fortified it ſelf by a long habit in Sin.</q> Behold the Picture of a Chriſtian Soul, that wiſhes to be truly devout, would only think on God and love him, but cannot. Nevertheleſs, how happy is ſuch a Soul and near to Devotion! When we ſeek God we are on the Eve of finding him. This is that Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs to which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes a Refreſhment. Theſe Deſires are the effects of Grace: but if Nature doth nothing in vain, with much ſtronger Reaſon does Grace. Theſe Deſires therefore cannot be fruitleſs, they will obtain their end, they will be filled one day. There's hardly any thing but wherein the vigour of the Soul, and the force of the Deſires, hit their mark: and hereby, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by the ſtrength of his Armies, did the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> vanquiſh the World, gain ſo many Battels, take ſo many Cities, and trample on the Necks of conquered Nations: when things neceſſary to the Accompliſhment of his Deſigns fail'd him, the vigour of his Courage, that is, the force of his Deſires, ſerved inſtead of them. If the Deſires can perform ſo much in <hi>things without us,</hi> and independent on our Will, what cannot they do in that which depends thereon, and is vertually our Will it ſelf?</p>
               <p>To make theſe pious deſires ſucceed, we are to call God to our aid: theſe are younglings, that he has cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be born, and 'tis his Intereſt to nouriſh them; theſe be the <hi>Aurora</hi> of that Sun, who doth not fail to come and fully enlighten us, provided he be invok'd with fervour. Here is therefore another Adviſo, which is but a Corollary and a Deduction from the former:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151353:85"/>We muſt aſk of God the grace of Devotion, and in his preſence groan after what we have not. If there be any favour of our Vows and Tears, if there is any Gift that comes immediately from Heaven, 'tis this Virtue; for nothing is more pure and more elevated among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151353:88"/>to Prayer, as is inconceivable. He comes to God with the Lightneſs and Alacrity of a Servant, who preſents himſelf before his Maſter, after having done his Duty, to obtain the Reward: for, although he acknowledges he deſerves nothing at God's hands, yet he knows, that God liberally recompenſeth us for what we do only by the help of his Grace. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to the Altar with the Confidence of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that appears before his Prince with Preſents, which he knows are capable of opening the way to his Heart: for, though our good Works be moſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Gifts, that hold not what they have good in them but from God's Liberality, nevertheleſs, he is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that he accepts them as if they were of great Price. Inſomuch, as I will not make any difficulty to ſay, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns,</hi> who have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd the <hi>Active</hi> Life of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> from the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative,</hi> and have believed, that this can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, and even that the Contemplative Life was far more excellent than the other, are aſſuredly in a great errour: for, by ſeperating the Active life, which conſiſts in doing good to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and practiſing Charity to the afflicted and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the contemplative life, to which they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they could give themſelves up entirely, they have certainly depriv'd Devotion of a very great help. I have already confeſs'd there to be no need, that the Imployments of <hi>Martha,</hi> which have regard to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Service of our Saviour and his Members, ſhould take away from us the time conſecrated to <hi>Mary's</hi> works, torea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Meditation and Prayer. But we have time enough for all: When <hi>Mary</hi> ſhall have been ſufficiently heard, then its fit ſhe take the place of <hi>Martha.</hi> Wherefore I would not counſel him that wou'd attain to perfect Devotion, to renounce that part of the World which conſiſts of the afflicted Members of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> This is the School of Virtue and Piety; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:151353:88"/>ſo far is it, that this practiſe of works of Mercy can diſtract devout Souls, that it is the readieſt and ſureſt way to arrive at Devotion.

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The third general Direction; To be watchful over the Senſes, and not let the Heart looſe.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SO near a commerce is there between the Heart and the Senſes, that our ſtrife would be in vain to guard the one, unleſs we ſet a ſtrict watch over the other. The Heart is the Houſe; the Senſes are the Gates and Windows. And hereat does the Devil enter and ſeiſes on our Souls. This Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my prepares ſo many batteries without as we have external Senſes, and if we eſcape Death on one ſide, he ſends it us on the other. Notwithſtanding, this we may ſay in vindication of the Senſes, that they are more unhapy than criminal: they have a ſenſation of what they ought to have according to the order of Creation: and even the greateſt part of <hi>Ideas,</hi> which come to 'em, are innocent, but they are ſpoyled in arriving at the Heart. The beauty of a Woman, the glitter of Gold and Silver and precious Stones, the ſweetneſs of vocal Muſick are the works of God, and conſequently they cannot be evil: but 'tis the Heart poyſons theſe innocent Images. Nevertheleſs, ſince the Heart doth not ſcatter it's poyſon but upon the Objects which are preſented to it, we ſhould take away the matter of its Crimes, and it's miſchievous <hi>Habits</hi> would be aſſuredly deſtroy'd and loſt, if they wanted Employment; and therefore it's of abſolute neceſſity to have a conſtant guard over the Senſes. <hi>I made an agreement with mine Eyes,</hi> ſays an holy man, <hi>not to look upon all Women.</hi> This has been ever the cuſtom of thoſe who would become truly devout, to hold their Souls ſhut up to the multitude of Objects that might aſſault 'em on all ſides. True it is, the uſage of this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime has bin puſht on and wreſted even to <hi>Superſtition:</hi> ſome have voluntarily baniſht themſelves into Deſarts, that they might ſee nothing at all: Others have lock'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:151353:90"/>themſelves up in Cells and Caves never to come forth. And Hiſtory tells us of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hermit, who would never agree to let his Siſter have the Pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him. He receiv'd Order from his Superiour, at the intreaty of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to go and viſit her: he went, but he preſented himſelf before her with his Eyes ſhut, and would by no means ſee her: <hi>Glut thy ſelf quickly</hi> (ſayd he to her) <hi>with the ſight of me.</hi> Theſe exceſſes do a greater wrong and injury to Reaſon; than they bring help to Devotion. The Soul draws a vaſt aid from its ſenſes, when it knows how to make a good uſe of them. To ſtop all the Avenues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Knowledge may arrive to the Soul, is to keep it in a darkſome and lonely Priſon, and nouriſh it in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. What is true herein is, that 'tis dangerous for it to be concern'd about evil Objects; becauſe it carries thence a tincture which indiſpoſes it for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis no leſs dangerous to permit it to meddle too much with indifferent Objects, fince this diſſipates its ſtrength, and evermore it returns with ſomewhat of the Vain air of thoſe Courſes, it takes Abroad.</p>
               <p>This is the way of the Worlds living: we give, we receive Viſits; we expoſe our ſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>that is,</hi> to the contagion of every Comer. The eyes are always open'd to ſee new Objects; the Ears to hear News: Vain is our Diſcourſe; we ſay there a thouſand impertinences and more of evil than good things. One willl entertain you with a Dreſs; Another with a little intrigue of the Town: Others will pour profane or back-biting diſcourſes into your Breaſt. One will carry you to ſee a new Houſe, or any fine building: One lately come from a new World will tell you ſtrange things, and enlarge his Recitals with Stories and Miracles, which he himſelf had been concern'd in: and your Soul will return to your Houſe charged with theſe Toys and Gew-gaws. When it would enter into its Cloſet, it's certain, it will not find
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:151353:91"/>the Heart in its ordinary Diſpoſitions: and upon that account it is the more difficult to be Devout in great Cities, where you can ſcarcely defend your ſelves from theſe Amuſements; ſo that I would advice the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul to keep its ſelf up cloſe. The Souls of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people are like to your great Streets, they are open to every Comer; we are never there but in a crowd: and Devotion, which loves Privacy, is not pleaſed with theſe publick places. Theſe are Inns where all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are lodg'd well, and the Maſter lyes oft out of Doors: But the heart of the faithful Perſon ought to be for himſelf, and God who is its Maſter, is to be ever at Large. <hi>A Garden incloſed is my Siſter, my Spouſe; a Spring ſhut up, a Fountain ſealed,</hi> ſays Jeſus Chriſt to his Spouſe, that is, to every Chriſtian Soul. Lock up this Garden, if thou wouldſt preſerve the Flowers and Fruits, and let not the purity of thy living Waters be corrupted by unclean Beaſts. Temples and Oratories are not to be acceſſible to the prophane: our Hearts are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt; and therefore let us ſhut the Gates againſt a thouſand indiſcreet Ideas and vain Objects, that would prophane them. The Soul is a veſſel which Grace fills with ſweet Odours; but we ſhould not give it too much Air, otherwiſe it would eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate and become inſipid. If the veſſel be full it can receive nothing new without loſing what it had before. If it be filled with Devotion, and we bring it into the World, according to the meaſure it is filled with Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, theſe Vanities will ſend what it had good a packing away. 'Tis a truth we are to fix in our memories, that at all times we make any ſally into the World, we loſe ſo much of our own. <hi>Dinah</hi> went out to ſee the Daughters of the Land, and ſhe loſt her beſt ornament, the flower of her Virginity. But eſpecially let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that in ſeeking out harmleſs Objects, we do not meet with ſinful ones: every where the Devil is in ambuſh, he has made Nets of the very Roſes. Sin
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151353:91"/>reigns in all places; ſo that if we ſlip aſide but a little, we moſt certainly meet with it; and then we ſhall find it a very difficult matter to avoid Infection.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe, that with a ſet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign go into places, where they are ſure Sin domineers, and Vice triumphs? After having loſt half of their time in preparing themſelves for a Ball, they will give the other part to the Devil, and plunge themſelves into criminal Pleaſures. Theſe people are deliberate murtherers of themſelves in Ambuſh, and God will moſt juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them an account of their Souls. Of all this, I conclude that the Devout Perſon ought to be very reſerved as to the World, that he is not to be ſeen but by very few, and to ſee much fewer, and that he ought to get rid of that vain curioſity to know what paſſes therein. 'Tis enough for him to know what paſſes in his own heart, and well to regulate all its motions: Of what Importance to him is it to learn what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of ſuch a Fleet, what ſucceſs had ſuch a Battel, how proſpered ſuch a Negotiation, how goe the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on of Peace, or the preparatives for War? The knowledge of all this cannot make him happy: theſe are only <hi>Ideas,</hi> which are heapt in the memory, and thence do not fail to make an irruption upon his Heart amidſt his pious Duties.</p>

                  <p>HOW happy wilt thou be, O my Soul, when thou ſhalt be in that place, where thou ſhalt have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear, where thou ſhalt be able to ſoar aloft, and fly ſucceſſively on an infinite number of Objects, and abandon thy ſelf intirely to contemplation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of thoughts! This Happineſs will arrive to thee, when thou ſhalt be in Heaven. All Objects there will tell thee of thy Duty, and ſollicit thee to Obedience. Thou ſhalt be no more afraid, leaſt <hi>Snakes</hi> lye under the Flowers, or the Devil be in Ambuſh in thoſe places whither thy Mind and ſteps ſhall carry thee. Thy mind
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:151353:92"/>being become vaſt will fear no Diſſipation; it will embrace all Objects without fear of being overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and for the being fill'd with an infinite number of the moſt different <hi>Ideas,</hi> thy God will not have the leſs room in thee, ſince all thoſe <hi>Ideas</hi> will be hallowed and belov'd by God. But now here there's nothing of the like; thou canſt not take one Step without running into danger; thou canſt not go out from thy ſelf without meeting an Enemy that ſeeks thee and has ſworn thy Ruine; thou canſt not admit into thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom all thoſe Objects which in a Crowd come to thy Senſes, but thou filleſt thy Heart therewith, and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſt God of the place he ought alone to poſſeſs. Make not therefore ſo many Sallies into the Univerſe where thou wilt always leave off thy own: contain thy ſelf within the Bounds of thine own Heart; if it be not ſo large, it is very deep, and thou wilt find ample matter enough wherewith to exerciſe thy ſelf. Thou wilt never be able to ſound it to the Bottom; it cannot be known but by him that tryeth the Reins and Thoughts; but at leaſt pierce into that impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable Subject as far as thou canſt. Examine thy ſelf, and this Knowledge of what paſſes in thee will be worth more than the Knowledge of all that is done in the World, and paſſeth amongſt men: Mingle not thy ſelf with Wars or Diſentanglings of Eſtates, and ſuch Particulars. Take notice of thoſe Combats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thy Fleſh and thy Spirit, between the Law of thy Members and that of thy Underſtanding. Pacifie theſe differences; teach the Fleſh to be obedient; place Reaſon again in it's Throne; give it Piety for a Counſellor; tame the Paſſions and make them Slaves. Put thy little Eſtate into a good order, and both wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and holily govern that great People which is ſhut up in ſo little a Country, that is to ſay, that multitude of Affections, Thoughts, Sentiments, and Paſſions, which are in thy Heart.</p>

               <p>WE have not repreſented Devotion as an eaſie thing to obtain, and therefore the Faithful need not be ſurpriz'd to meet with difficulties therein; much leſs are they to withdraw and deſpond: 'tis a new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice I gave here to obtain it. Every upright Soul has frequently made experience, that in being willing to lift it ſelf up it has found the Wings of its Devotion clogged either by worldly Vanities or the ſluggiſhneſs of the Fleſh: in this Eſtate, if it relax, it is undone. Theſe Deſires, ſo neceſſary (as we have ſeen) muſt have Action and Courage joyn'd to them. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks in his Proverbs of the Motion of an idle Man, whoſe whole Strength was exhauſted in deſires: He always makes the beſt Reſolutions in the World, but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:151353:93"/>never ſtirs out of his place. This lazineſs of the Soul perhaps might be what <hi>Solomon</hi> refers ſo much to; for he hath hardly a Chapter, but [as he paſſes along] he has a hit at the Sluggard. This ſluggiſhneſs of the Soul is the Vice of thoſe who drain themſelves dry in praiſing Vertue, and reſerve no ſtrength to run after and attain it. The falſly devout one does the ſame thing; he praiſes, he deſires it, but he yields to the firſt Temptation his Devotion meets withal. But doſt not thou know, that all <hi>Great</hi> things are difficult? Doth a Pilot abandon his Veſſel at the firſt rough Blaſt of Wind? Doth not a Rower, that goes againſt the Stream of a rapid River, ſtruggle ſtiffly to refiſt the Water? He holds on, tugs, wipes his Fore-head, takes Courage, and at laſt he overcomes. Does a Merchant renounce all Traffick for one loſs; or a Courtier all his hopes for one ill turn of Fortune? Every one ſtrives to regain by Diligence what his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace had taken away from him. We muſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly bend our ſelves againſt Indevotion; and when we perceive our Heart ill diſpos'd, its motions lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, and its Devotions travers'd by Wand'rings, we are to quell and take our Heart lower till we have brought it to its Duty; we are to read, meditate, pray, let it be never ſo much againſt the Grain. <q>Although the Devil comes to fill your Mind with evil thoughts, (ſays St. <hi>Baſil</hi>) you ought not therefore to abandon the uſe of Prayer; you are to make new and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Endeavours. You muſt pray to God he would be pleas'd to break this thick Wall of vain thoughts which ſeparates you from him: you muſt beſeech him, that your Soul may be able ſoon to get to him without being retarded by meeting vain and evil Objects. And if the Enemy ſhould come even with a plentiful ſupply of Diſtractions, yet you are not to give back, nor loſe any Courage, nor renounce Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in the midſt of the Combate. You muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:151353:93"/>till God, perceiving your Conſtancy, come to fill you with the light of his Spirit, put the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to flight, purifie your Underſtanding, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your Reaſon with a divine Light, whereby your Soul, being put into the Poſſeſſion of a Tranquillity exempt from Troubles, may ſerve God with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Joy.</q> This holy Perſon inſinuates a Reaſon to us, which we ought to remember in the deſign of <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance;</hi> which is, That the Devil never leaves off tempting us; therefore we are not to leave off reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: our reſiſtance doth not make him give back, ſo that we muſt not be foiled by his Temptations. God, who is the Spectator of our Warfare, and the Rewarder of our Labours, will with Pleaſure ſee the faithful Soul in conflict with it's Infirmities and Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and when it is well nigh being ſubdued, will come at length and lend it his helping hand.</p>
               <p>Perſeverance is a vertue of ſuch great uſe, that we owe to it the beſt works of <hi>Nature,</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and of <hi>Grace.</hi> If God had left the World imperfect, inſtead of a Miracle, he had made a Prodigy. There are particularly certain works, to which the <hi>laſt-hand</hi> is ſo eſſential, that if we do not conclude them, what had been begun, doth intirely periſh. If you leave a Picture after its firſt rough-drawing and deſign, theſe beginnings will not ceaſe ſubſiſting upon the cloath: but if you carry a wheel half way upon an hill, and then leave it to it ſelf for a moment; why, preſently it will get to the Valley's bottom again, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will not only be imperfect, but will come juſt to nothing. Devotion is of this laſt ſort of things: if you leave it half done, what you had done, will ſoon periſh. 'Tis <hi>Penelope</hi>'s web; what is done by day, is undone by night. If thy life be not a perpetual day, and if thou doſt not inceſſantly toil to advance thy Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Practice, one night only form'd by the darkneſs of Indevotion and the abſence of Gods Grace, will ruine
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:151353:94"/>the work of many years, and one minute of lazineſs will deſtroy that which Courage, upheld a long time, had produced. Thy Devotion, <hi>O Christian</hi> Soul, is no more than a ſpark. Nouriſh this ſacred fire preciouſly, blow it without remiſſion, gather combuſtible matter to it from all ſides; make thee a treaſure of good things, turn oft towards <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt, thy Sun and thy Star, and this ſmall ſparkle will become a great fire, and this fire will cauſe a kindling, and that kindling will caſt up flames, and thoſe flames will lift thee to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: But if thou neglect this ſpark, it will go quite out. <hi>Sampſon</hi> delivers himſelf up into the arms of <hi>Dalilah,</hi> he ſleeps in her breaſt, his hair is ſhav'd, which is the ſeat of his ſtrength, and when the awakes he goes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to cuſtom to take away the gates of <hi>Gath,</hi> and break the cords of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> but he doth not find himſelf the ſame <hi>Sampſon.</hi> So the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that is weakned by a non-aſſiduity to Devotion, ſleeps in the arms of Pleaſure; his Soul is enervated: he thinks to return to his old wont of having commere with God, but the Devil attacks and overthrows him by a load of evil thoughts, under which his Devotion lyes bound as by ſo many Chains.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Heavens</hi> ſhould ſtop only for a day, perhaps there would follow a general ſlaughter and ſubverſion of Nature; and much more without doubt the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior things would receive a conſiderable damage. When the ſuperior part of our Soul ſtops its divine motions, we cannot queſtion but that a great diſorder ariſes in the lower part: for the paſſions which would ever be the maſters, do manage wiſely theſe moments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation to prepare a Revolt. So that our Piety and Devotion muſt have the conſtancy, ſwiftneſs and order of the heavenly motions, ſo as this <hi>little World</hi> may be always in a good Eſtate. Nothing ſhould hinder or interrupt the courſe of Devotion. You ſee <hi>Daniel,</hi> all the terrours of Death could not ſtop him in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:151353:94"/>race. He muſt be caſt into the den of Lions; if he invokes God; yet this hinders him not from falling down at his ſet hours towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the holy City Above all, let us be far from the way of the World, that runs to its own affairs, as if they were the moſt preſſing. Let us give to God preſerably, what belongs to him: and let us be at no farther trouble for the reſt. 'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that he ſecures his head, when he is purſued, and expoſes his body, if he can't ſave it. The hours conſecrated to Devotion are the head of our life, and 'tis an holy <hi>prudence</hi> not to expoſe them but to draw them out of Danger, leaſt the Devil and the World devour them.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, perſevering is far better than violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, 'tis much better to go a little pace, but to be going always, that to run impetuous, yet interrupted races. Some are devout only by fits: for a day, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ardent, more humble, more mov'd; but on the morrow ſo well dryed up in the torrent of their Tears, that you can't ſee ſo much as the tracks of 'em. The ardency of this fever is ſo extremely well quench'd as the leaſt heat is not to be found. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant mediocrity is preferable before theſe Exceſſes of a ſmall Duration. Not that I think it not very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that Devotion have its Feſtivals, and labour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily to rewaken it ſelf on certain dayes and times. Theſe are the Extraordinaries of Piety, to which we are to return as frequently as we can, and mainly never to want it at times deſtin'd to pious Uſes and Works; as the participation of the bleſſed Sacrament of our Lord's Body and Blood: But beſide theſe Extraordinaries, I would have the Soul have it's ordinary courſe well regulated; and if that cannot be done always with thoſe great motions, as it were to be wiſht, yet that it never fall in the leaſt in the Reſpites and Intermiſſions.</p>

                  <p>HAve not I great reaſon to faint, and deſpair of ſucceſs in all my deſigns, if I do but conſider the greatneſs of the Undertakings, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to be met withal therein, and the meanneſs of my own Strength; or, to ſpeak better, my Weakneſs, and my Nothing. I aim at great things, for I aim at becoming one with my God. I would become like him; I would renew his Image in me; I would cleanſe my Heart, ſo corrupt with Sin; I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build this great Houſe which Sin and the Devil have brought to ruin; I would aſcend the Throne; I wou'd become King and Prieſt to God my Father. Alas! my Soul, where in thy ſelf wilt thou find ſtrength to do ſuch great things, thou, who art only Darkneſs, Weakneſs, and Pollution? If thou had'ſt no other Enemy to engage with but the Devil, how wilt thou vanquiſh that red Dragon which hath ſeven Heads and ten Horns? That wicked Serpent at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning poyſoned our firſt Parents with the breath of his Mouth. And now he infects all the Sources where we drink; he lays his Snares in all our Paths; and more eſpecially, he never makes greater Endeavours to deſtroy us than when we make ours to unite us to God by Prayer and Devotion: then he ſtirs up all the Fantomes of our Imagination to carry us out from God's Preſence: He raiſes the Waves of our Paſſions and Concupiſcence to keep us from that ſafe Harbour. And truly, 'tis his Intereſt to do thus; for thou never fighteſt him, O my Soul, with more Succeſs, than by Prayer, when fervent and devout: ſo that he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles Heaven and Earth together to diſtract thee, and inſtill into thee Sentiments of Coldneſs. Do notflat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy ſelf: if thou doſt not ſee the Enemy with thy fleſhly Eyes, yet he ſhoots his fiery Darts at thee: he ſpeaks with thee, he attacks thee, he tempts thee by the mouth of thy Luſt, which never fails him, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:151353:95"/>has made a League with him. But ſtill, O my Soul! loſe no Courage: if thou canſt do nothing of thy ſelf, thou canſt do all things through thy Saviour, who ſtrengthens thee. Watch, be ſober, perſevere, lay this evil Spirit, and drive him far from thee: <hi>Reſist the Devil and he will flee from you.</hi> He preſſes upon none but thoſe that give back.</p>

               <p>THis is a Remedy for moſt Miſchiefs, but 'tis particularly ſo againſt Indevotion. I ſhall ſay by and by, that the Faithful ought to have their hours of Devotion wherein to retrace expreſly the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of the Divinity in their Mind, and awaken it to remember his Benefits and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151353:96"/>Graces: But this is not what I mean at preſent; I ſpeak of that continual, and (as it were) habitual Thought of God, which is never to be abandoned. 'Tis a delicate and moſt ſpiritual Meditation, which comes a croſs to rob our worldly Affairs of thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it conſecrates to Heaven: 'Tis a ſublime Operation of an Underſtanding illuminated by the light of Grace, that finds God <hi>all in all,</hi> that mixeth him in all our Actions, and ſpieth him out in all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. 'Tis an act of the Soul, whereby, amid humane Affairs, it turns without Violence to God-ward, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough an Habit it has acquir'd. It makes all things to be as ſo many Ladders to ſcale Heaven, and all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to put one in mind of God. An Artificer while he is working, a Traveller in his Journey, a Scholar in his Study, will find means to ſanctifie what each does, in cauſing God to intervene by pious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let the Lamb follow thee, O faithful Soul, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever thou goeſt, that thou may'ſt be able one day to follow him whither he ſhall go. If thou art lying down in thy Bed, think on the Tomb of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who, for thy Salvation, was pleaſed to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chambers of Death. Art thou near falling on ſleep, think on Chriſt, whoſe eyes were ſhut by the ſleep of Death. An Infant juſt born will recall to thee the thought of thy Lord's Abaſement and Humility in his Birth. An unhappy Perſon that ſuffers for his fins, will bring thee to think on <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who ſuffered for thine. One that asks an Alms, will ask it for Chriſt his ſake, or will tell thee, that he became poor, that thou might'ſt be rich. In a word out of all things 'tis eaſie for thee to extract an Occaſion to think on thy God. What ſhall I ſay of the Objects of Nature, that put thee in mind of him almoſt againſt thy Will? If thou riſeſt betimes, thou canſt not ſee the Sun riſing, without thinking on him, that has made this work, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being reminded of the Sun of thy Soul, who pours
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151353:96"/>forth the gleams of his Grace into thy Heart, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe thence all Darkneſs. The Woods, the Rivers, the Mountains, the Feilds cover'd with harveſt Corn, the Trees, Fruits, Flowers, all in ſhort will entertain and complement thee with thy God: <hi>For the Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy Work.</hi> The Flyes and Worms themſelves ſpeak this, ſince we ſee the Divinity ſhowing in them: For as St <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays well, <hi>this worker in ſuch a manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears great in great things, that he does not appear leſſs great in the leaſt of his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are therefore to form an Habit to our ſelves of thinking on God, even while we do every thing, and this will be the true way of doing well, what we do, and engaging God to do it with us. Now there are ſome Employments, which take not the Soul intirely up. A workman at his work, or a woman in ſuch concerns as are ordinary to that Sex, will roul about in their Imagination a thouſand <hi>Chimerical</hi> deſigns, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down every where, and think of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred things ſucceſſively: But what is it, reſtrains 'em from giving up to God that part of their Soul and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which they deduct from their other work? why will they not think of their Redeemer, of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligarions they have to him, and the Acknowledgement and Recollection, which they rather owe to him than to a vain chat and converſation, they have had ſome where or other, or ſome adventure, the recital of which had diverted them. <q>We are carefully to guard out heart, ſays a father of the Church, and never to let the thought of God to abandon it, for fear the memory of God's wonderfull doings ſhould be ſtifled under the croud of vain thoughts. We ought to do it in ſuch ſort, that by a continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the thought of the Deity be fixt in us like the indelible impreſſion of a Seal and Wax.</q>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:151353:97"/>This is not ſo impoſſible as ſome at firſt ſight may imagine it; for a Soul truly devout thinks on God not only without any trouble, but frequently without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving what lead it to think on him. Thy praiſe, ſays holy <hi>David,</hi> ſhall be continually in my Mouth-Upon which the ſame Author, (whom we have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for almoſt every where) makes this Queſtion: <q>How can this be done? Can a man in the midſt of humane Affairs and Converſations have the praiſes of the Lord in his Mouth? When he ſleeps, when he drinks, when he eats, and even when he holds his Peace, can he ſing the Praiſes of God? I anſwer, ſays he, there is within man an intellectual Mouth, whereby he receives the Word of Life, which is his heavenly Bread; nought hinders him from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always the praiſes of God in his Mouth: and I ſay that the thought of God being ingrav'd and (as it were) ſealed one the upper part of the Soul, may be call'd a praiſe, that never leaves the Heart.</q>

               <p>In ſhort, we cannot conceive how mighty an help to Devotion this is. When we are to ſeek God a far off, the Soul wanders in the way: but if it holds God always near it, it cannot be to ſeek for him. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> how eaſie is it to put the Heart into the ſteps of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and the ways of its Saviour, when it never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the ſight of him! If you let a Furnace grow wholly cold, it cannot be heated again without great trouble and coſt; but if you take care to keep up the fire with a little refreſhing, you will conſerve that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of heat that is neceſſary to it. If our Soul in like manner relents it ſelf, and makes an interruption from thinking on God, we muſt take much pains to kindle the Flames of Devotion afreſh: and therefore we are ever to keep it in Exerciſe.</p>
               <p>This continual thinking on God is a moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrifice unto him, like to the morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice, which was call'd alſo the continual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;

                  <hi>Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,</hi> They who look to theſe <hi>Automatous Machines,</hi> obſerve daily to wind them up at the ſame hours, otherwiſe they are put out of Order. And this, I ſay, is to be obſerved in the conduct of a faithful Soul.</p>
               <p>All hours are good: for Heaven is alwayes open, and God's Throne evermore acceſſible; yet ſome there are more proper than others. Thoſe of the Morning are ſo truly God's, that we cannot rob him of them without Sacriledge. If God will have the firſt-fruits of our Herds, with much ſtronger reaſon he will have the firſt of our hours: And what time more proper to lift up our Eyes and our Hearts to the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than that wherein the ſenſible Sun ariſes upon the Earth? Is it not time then that the Morning-ſtar ariſe in our hearts, and Prayer open the Gate to Grace? At what hour, with better effect, can we lift up our hearts to God, than at the beginning of a Race, the ſucceſs where of depends intirely on him? In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we ought to ſeal our hearts with holy thoughts, and fill our minds with chaſte and good <hi>Ideas,</hi> that the Corruption in the World, which the reſt of the day will by the Senſes give a thouſand aſſaults to our heart, may find it well fortified. This will be a morning-dew, which in falling from Heaven upon our Souls, will make them fruitful in all good works for the reſt of the day. This will be an Amulet againſt the evil air of the World without which we are not to leave our Lodgings, nor expoſe our ſelves to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of contagious Objects. As God ought to be the firſt thing in our Hearts, ſo he muſt be the laſt too: for he ſaith, I am <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the End. Let him open the door of our thoughts in the morning, and ſhut it up in the Evening. This will be a Seal which the Devils will reſpect; tho we be diſarmed all, while aſleep, they will tremble at our ſight and will not dare to come near us. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:151353:100"/>Angel in paſſing by will reverence this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and this fruit of the Blood of the Lamb. Theſe Evening-Devotions will be an holy Seed caſt on good Land, which will not fail to ſpring up in the morning; ſince the heart will find it no trouble to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the preſent Journey, where it had ended the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding one. And in as much as 'tis true, that the Soul, abandon'd to its ſelf in ſleep, is naturally carried to the laſt Objects of its waking, we need not doubt, but the dreams will be happy, and the Images which ariſe from thoſe laſt impreſſions which Piety had made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart, will be very ſweet ones.</p>
               <p>The night it ſelf is perfectly a friend to Devotion. 'Tis there that recollectings are very eaſie, the Soul being not diſſipated by preſent Objects. Nothing is ſweeter than to fill the heart with God, when void of other things. God is well pleas'd if a faithful Soul makes an Altar of its bed, and makes him its vows in a retreat where are no witneſſes. Let thy body be laid provided thy Soul be elevated and thou fall upon the knees of thy Heart, as <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> phraſes it. Theſe nightly Communications with God ſeem more near and ſtrict; ſince laying our ſelves down in our beds we bid fare-well to the World, and baniſh its cares and troubles from us, to give repoſe to the body. The Soul finds it ſelf in a bleſt eſtate, and at its waking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſengaged from the World, it hath all manner of Liberty to mount up to God.

For thou draggeſt after thee a bodily priſon, which is an hindrance to thee.

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:151353:102"/>How ſhould the Soul, I wonder, be recollected into it ſelf, if a thouſand Objects lay hold on the Senſes, and draw it abroad? We muſt therefore be in ſuch a place where we need not defend it againſt the Aſſaults which ſenſual Objects make upon it. Let us retire never ſo far from the World, we ſhall be ſure to carry enough of the World along with us, and the Images of its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects will perſecute us ſufficiently, without being volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily expoſed to the perſecution of the Objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Yes, the Commerces of the faithful Soul with its God require a ſecret retiral. Our Lord is its Beloved, who caſts not his Favours upon the Crowd, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them not to the ſight of men, as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes, He loves Shadow and Retreat. And therefore the Spouſe will not let him go whom her Soul loveth, until ſhe has brought him into her Mothers houſe, and into her clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. If we have a deſign to do any thing wherein is need of Application, we ſeek a Retreat, that we may not be diſtracted: We are therefore to ſeek it for Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince nothing in the World asks a more fix'd Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Far from all Witneſſes muſt the truly Devout Perſon be, to be intirely Free in all reſpects. Devotion has its Actions and its Words: it impreſſes its tranſports and motions upon the Soul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd the Body frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may have its too; ſo that it ſhould not be expos'd to the view of men, who make ſo ill Judgments thereof. If theſe Reaſons have need of being upheld by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we have that of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to whom the Mountains did not ſeem ſecret or ſolitary enough; ſince he added to them the darkneſs of the Night: That of <hi>Daniel,</hi> who ſhut the door of his Chamber to pray: That of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who went upon the Houſe-top to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Devotions: But this Subject is ſo little diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and indeed ſo little diſputable, as we need not dwell upon it longer.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of Solitarineſs for Devotion, may give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s more extenſive Proſpects. There have been many
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:151353:103"/>great men, and (I would believe) many great Saints, who have thought Devotion and Solitude were ſo inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, as that not only the truly devout were to ſet aſide ſome hours of Retreat, but their whole Life ought to be conſecrated to it. And 'twas this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſometime peopled the Deſarts of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and of <hi>Syria,</hi> with ſo many <hi>Anchorites.</hi> They fled the World to lift up their Souls more eaſily to God, and to acquire an habit of more pure and ardent Devotion. And hence perhaps might come the very name of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> which is deriv'd from <hi>vowing</hi> ones ſelf to a thing, becauſe thoſe Chriſtians by a Vow, in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, conſecrated themſelves to God.</p>
               <p>'Tis a matter extremely difficult to pronounce upon this ſort of Life; I would not condemn all thoſe that follow it. I do not doubt but many were led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs, as our Saviour was: but I dare boldly ſay, that this Eſtate is ſubject to as great Temptations as a worldly life is. In my opinion, it's very much to preſume on one's own Strength, to go and lye expoſed to the ſtrokes of an Enemy ſo potent as the Devil. In Society, if one falls, another helps him up again, but in the Wilderneſs he muſt ſuſtain himſelf; he muſt ſtand upon his own bottom; he muſt be his own Paſtor, Guide, and Director of Conſcience: and he that believes he has Light enough to furniſh for all theſe Duties, hath too high an opinion of himſelf. I would ſpeak here nothing more forcible againſt this way of living, than what St. <hi>Baſil</hi> himſelf, a great Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Admirer of the Monaſtic Life, hath writ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He believes that that ſort of Life is no more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table than it is prudent. They have either need of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour themſelves, or they are in a condition to give it to others. If they ſtand in need themſelves, 'tis an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prndence to be confined in a place where they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none. If they can afford it to others, this is to want Charity, and to rob Society of what might be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:151353:103"/>uſeful to it. And with good reaſon he ſayes, that this is to deprive ones ſelf of the Hope to hear, one day, thoſe words from our Lord's Mouth, <q>Thou gaveſt meat to him that was an hungred, drink to him that was thirſty; thou clothedſt him that was naked, and viſitedſt him that was in Priſon.</q> In ſhort, I fear the Remark of this Father in the ſame place is not over true, that this Life (ſo far out of the path of Humility) is not a Stair-caſe to Pride: for theſe men, comparing themſelves to themſelves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, and ſeeing nothing more accompliſht than themſelves, perſuade themſelves they are Perfect. Every one ſees himſelf too near to know himſelf well, and does not know himſelf thoroughly enough to correct himſelf; and therefore an <hi>Anchoret</hi> who uſes not the eyes of another to examin himſelf, lets many ſins, without doubt, eſcape him, to which, Judges more ſevere than we are to our ſelves, would not have done that favour. To be brief; I have ſaid that ſo far is this kind of living from any great uſe to Devotion, as I believe 'tis an impediment to it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is depriv'd of exerciſing the Works of Mercy, which are ſo neceſſary. A man in the Deſart hath his diſtractions; and if he have not a Soul of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary temper, 'tis to be fear'd, they are more dangerous than thoſe met withall in the World. A mind aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, without any Guide, makes oftentimes ſtrange ſlips. The wide World, and a narrow Lowlineſs, are moſt aſſuredly two very dangerous Extremities. There is need of extraordinary Grace to thrive well in either Conditions: ſo that thoſe who have receiv'd indifferent Gifts from Heaven, are to chooſe a Life that holds the middle betwixt theſe two Extreams. But, at leaſt, 'tis without Controverſie, that Solitude is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at hours deſtin'd to Devotion: Which is not to be taken in ſuch a manner as to do any prejudice to holy Aſſemblies or Publick Devotions. They have their Uſe for Devotion, and under Pretext of praying in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:151353:104"/>our Cloſet, we are never to deprive our ſelves of ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary an Aid to Piety. True it is, every where elſe our Senſes are enemies to Self-recollection; but there both the Senſes and Imagination favour the motions of the devout Soul. The looking upon Churches, which are God's houſes, the preſence of Angels, who aſſiſt in thoſe places; the ſociety of a multitude of Souls that joyn their Vows as well as their Voices together; the Word of God reſounding in our Ears; the Prayers that are united, and being conceived by many hearts, make up but one Vow: All theſe things extremely help the Soul to make its elevations, and ſerve very much to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh worldly <hi>Ideas,</hi> to make holy ones ſucceed in their ſtead. Nay, 'tis not impoſſible too, but that among ſuch a crowd we may conſerve Solitude it ſelf. A Soul tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devout, in ſuch places, is ſo collected into its ſelf, that all the Objects which might do it an injury can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find it; the faithful Perſon is in the Cloſet of his own heart; he leaves no door open but for God's Word, and for things able to inſtill Piety: but the doors are ſhut againſt the vain Objects that are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be ſeen in ſuch places. <q>There is a Spiritual So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude as well as a Corporeal, <hi>ſayes St. Bernard,</hi> and that is only in the midſt of a throng, which is exempt from vain and frivolous thoughts.</q> But 'tis an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Profaneneſs to have indevour Diſpoſitions in the Church, to have there an heart open to all Vainities, to go thither to ſee and to be ſeen, to hear to get mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to play upon, and to catch at Syllables and Words. How great an account will theſe People have to make! 'Tis enough ſure to have offended man, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all the dayes in the Week, there needs no coming on the Sunday to declare War againſt him in his face. I ſhall not inlarge here to ſpeak of the manner after which we ſhould act in Religious Aſſemblies, becauſe I deſign here only to give Rules for Cloſet-Devotion.</p>

                  <p>WHere ſhall I find an happy Solitude, that may be to me an aſſured Sanctuary againſt the Perſecution of the enemies of my Soul? If I go from the World, I carry it along with me; if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into my Cloſet, I am followed by a crowd of fleſhly thoughts, that perfectute me cruelly. When I would ſave my ſelf in Deſarts, and dwell in the Rocks with the Owl and Cormorant, Vulturs are there, thoſe griping Cares that would tear and prey upon my Entrails. I ſhould be aſſail'd there by Flocks of Birds, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of vain and light Thoughts, which would lift me up from my ſelf, to throw me into the World. What muſt I do to remedy this great Evil? Thou knoweſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, O Lord, I do not know it, do thou teach me. Here below there is no Heaven that can ſhelter and ſhrowd me from theſe Tempeſts; no charms that can lay theſe Devils, and conjure down theſe Fantoms of my Imagination. I muſt make me a new heart; for this is not ſo much the World's fault as my own. 'Tis not becauſe it purſues me, but for that I have placed it within me, and, which way ſoever I go, I carry it with me. If my heart were pure and clean, in the midſt of Cities and the greateſt Aſſemblies I ſhould find Solitude. My Soul being drawn up into it ſelf would be environed on all ſides with a contempt of the World as with a Rampart; The love of God and Godlineſs would keep the Avenues; They would be a good Guard, and would drive all Objects away which might come to interrupt me, ſo as I ſhould be alwayes in a place of ſafety.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Soul comes into the World at leaſt as ill inſtructed in the affairs of Grace as in thoſe of Nature: It is in all reſpects a <hi>plain</hi> unſcrolled <hi>Table,</hi> and an Ignorant, which has need to be informed in every thing. Very eaſily it acquires the Knowledges which are neceſſary to the Conduct of Life, becauſe thoſe Directions paſs to it thorough the Senſes, and theſe Objects are of its own ſize: but it hath need of the greateſt endeavour to attain thoſe <hi>Notices,</hi> which regard the <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> ſince thoſe Objects are diſproportionate to its Strength; and yet thoſe Enowledges are of abſolute neceſſity to the practiſing the Virtues, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of Devotion. This laſt Virtue is made up of Love and Zeal, but we have not them but according to the degree of our Knowledge: and therefore, I know not of what nature thoſe ignorant Devotions can be which are deſtitute of all Light, and are not guided but by the Senſes: theſe are, it may be, rather weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Conſtitution than effects of Grace. The Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ignorant People are almoſt ever groſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; they are ordinarily fix'd to ſenſible Objects; whereas in Religion all is divine and intellectual: the Object of their Worſhip is moſtly an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or an <hi>Image:</hi> and God, who ought to be the ſole Object of our Devotions, has ſcarce any ſhare in their Veneration. I do'nt require our Chriſtian to be learned, and that he have prey'd either into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Nature, or alſo into the higheſt myſteries of Grace by an over-exact and curious Reſearch. I hold that that is more diſadvantageous than proſitable to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:151353:106"/>Devotion: but the devout Soul muſt be ſpiritual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to lift it ſelf up above the Senſes by Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Meditation is an excellent Operation of the Soul, whereby it penetrates the out-ſides of Objects, and ſounds them to the very heart: 'tis a reflected Action that rouls its ſubject upon the Heart till it makes deep Impreſſions; 'tis an happy Proſpect, by which the Soul every moment diſcovers more and more Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in that which it is about: but theſe Diſcoveries are not nice Speculations to be communicated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they are particular Sentiments and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Soul makes and which are only for it. We cannot doubt but this is of abſolute neceſſity to Devotion; for this does not embrace it's Subject but proportionably as Meditation makes it to enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Devotion is an agitation of a vigorous and lively Soul, whereby we are lifted up to God and to our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Good; and therefore, the more Devotion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies us to this great Object, and lets us ſee the depths of his Goodneſs, the more ardent doth Devotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: ſo that this is to be the principal Subject of our Contemplations. God is good, either in himſelf, or in reſpect had to us; in himſelf, becauſe he is great, majeſtic, bounteous, merciful: if we did not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Fruits of theſe Divine Vertues, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, God would not ceaſe to poſſeſs them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, he wou'd be infinitely amiable. We cannot think too often on theſe Attributes of God: this is one of the moſt efficacious means which <hi>David</hi> uſes to awaken his drowſie Devotion, <hi>Awake, O my Tongue,</hi> ſaith he, and thereupon he ſings God Almighty's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Works, his Majeſty ſhining forth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, his Juſtice in his Judgments, his Wiſdom in the Government of the World, his Mercy towards Man. But, becauſe <hi>Interest</hi> has ſo great a ſway with us, we are to joyn to this Confideration that-of-God's Benefits, to deſcend into the Abyſſes of his Love, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:151353:106"/>to conſider him in <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf: we muſt eſſay to dive [if poſſible it be] into the depths of his Mercy, which are found every where and in all parts of the Diſpenſation of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation: above all, we cannot fix our ſelves too much upon the Paſſion of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt; we ſhall ſee there a thouſand Objects able to mollifie our Soul, fince God's Love to Mankind appears there in all it's Extenſion. From general Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it is good to come to particular Applications; We ought to conceive how much we ſtand indebted to God for freeing us from ſo many Miſeries to raiſe us up to ſuch glorious hopes: in ſhort, and to ſpeak all in a Word, the Object of our Meditation is as vaſt as God, Nature, and Grace altogether: for there are no Flowers in the World but we may gather Honey from 'em: we need not fear therefore, that we can drain a Subject of ſo great a Bigneſs. But how comes it to paſs then our Meditations are frequently ſo dry, and our Recollections ſo barren? It is not from the Seed, but from the bad Ground. <q>Whence comes it, ſaith an Ancient Father, that our Mind is found de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of good Thoughts, as if there were nothing well-pleaſing to God wherewith we cou'd entertain our ſelves? This comes not, <hi>ſays he,</hi> but from a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of Spirit, for the ſubject is inexhauſtible; and if the Eye cannot reach the end of Wonders to be ſeen, much leſs can the Mind attain it in thoſe that are to be conceived: If the Eyes ceaſe to ſee the Light when it is day, 'tis not for that the Light is exſtinguiſh'd, but it proceeds from the diſſipation of the Sight.</q> If you pierce and open a Field in all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arts with a Plow-ſhare, it will render you an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Harveſt, otherwiſe 'twill continue barren; and even if you penetrate very deep you may find ſprings of living Water. In like manner, if you open this great Subject, to wit, God and his Works, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:151353:107"/>and frequent Meditations, there will proceed from thence Sources of Conſolations and Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, make no difficulty to repaſs oft upon the ſame ſubject for to make it familiar to you. Our Soul is depending upon the Body during the time we are upon Earth, and the moſt ſpiritual <hi>Idea</hi>'s are form'd in us by bodily motions: ſo that it is highly uſeful to let the Thoughts of things divine paſs and repaſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in our ſelves, to the intent we may give an Inclination to the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> which may carry 'em that aways, and at length we ſhall find they will go naturally in that Road, in ſuch ſort, as without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and before we are aware, we ſhall think on good things. I ſhall ſay one Word more for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of thoſe Minds which are not capable either of a piercing Infight or a ſtrong Application: and that is, That they are to be griev'd if they do not find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forcible enough to drive on their <hi>Reaſonings</hi> ſo far, and if Conceptions fail them, provided this comes not from any Coldneſs. Some ſhort, but frequent, Meditations, whereby a faithful Perſon of the meaner ſort does often apply his Mind to the Author of his Salvation and Gods Benefits, may ſerve inſtead of long Reflections when one is not capable of them.</p>
               <p>To help Devotion, we are, without doubt, to call in the reading of good Books; for, we muſt not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we can draw all from our own Well: and among thoſe Books the Holy Scripture is as much above all others as God is above Men, and the Sun above the Stars of the ſixth Magnitude. This is that Word which is as powerful and piercing as a two-edged Sword; this is that Fire which can warm our Entrails, and make us ſay, <hi>Does not our Heart burn within us?</hi> One only Paſſage in <hi>St. Paul (Let us walk honeſtly as in the day, not in Riotting and Drunkenneſs, not in Chambering and Wantonneſs, not in Strife and Envying; but put ye on the Lord</hi> Jeſus <hi>Christ</hi>) wrought the Converſion of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:151353:107"/>In every Page of this Book we ſhall find Gods Benefits, and his excellent Promiſes ſo proper to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken Devotion: we ſhall find there many Examples of heavenly Meditations, fit to lift up the Soul, and guide us in our own. Eſpecially the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is an ineſtimable Treaſure for devout Souls; and if we could prize it, and ſay of it beyond what the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents did, we could never ſay enough. 'Twere to be wiſh'd, that this Treaſure were laid up entirely in our Memory, that every moment we might be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them to our own Heart. We ſhould, if it were poſſible, habituate our Mind not to conceive its Thoughts, and form its Meditations, but in the terms which the Holy Ghoſt uſeth in the Pſalms.</p>
               <p>To the reading of Holy Scripture, it will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to add that of other good Books: and herein I would give a Direction which <hi>ſome</hi> People have found very good; which is, to chooſe ſuch Places and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Devotion which have once warmed you, and to return often to the ſame places, that your Heart may get an Habit of awakening it ſelf at that view. 'Tis the ordinary <hi>Turn</hi> of all <hi>Minds</hi> to joyn certain motions of Heart with certain <hi>Images,</hi> ſo as that aſſoon as the Images preſent 'emſelves to the Mind, thoſe motions ariſe in the Heart: for example, if a Man has run an extream danger in a Wood, the Image of a Foreſt will never offer it ſelf to his Imagination, but his Heart is ſeiz'd upon by ſome Chillneſs. So our Heart having been once mov'd at the reading of ſome pious Diſcourſe which had touch'd it to the Quick, will not fail of being awaken'd at the preſence of the ſame Thoughts, in caſe we read them with a devout Intention and a deſign to be touch'd therewith. This may be compar'd to what happens to barking Dogs, which are quiet or otherwiſe as ſoon as they hear the Voice of thoſe they are acquainted withal: ſo the Heart being become familiar with thoſe pious thoughts
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:151353:108"/>that had mov'd it oftentimes, will evermore perceive in their Preſence very near the ſame motions: for it is not ſo with reading in holy Books as in Profane; theſe pleaſe the firſt time, the ſecond the pleaſure ceaſes, but the third they are moſt inſupportable. The ſame thing perhaps may happen if you read a Book of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion for Divertiſement, to ſee there the neatneſs of Phraſe and the beauty of Thoughts: as this way of reading is for the Mind and not for the Heart, one thing will not pleaſe you a ſecond time. This Thought diſcovers a Myſtery to us ſomewhat obſcure, why that which touches ſome ſhould not have the ſame influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over others? Now the Reaſon is, becauſe all do not read with the ſame Diſpoſitions and the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. A Preacher, that would preach an hour upon a pious Subject, will read Books which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him therein; but if he has not a Soul naturally very devout, they will have no great effects upon him, becauſe he comes with no Intention to be moved by them; he only ſeeks for matter to fill up his hour. Our Heart does very near what we would have it do; inſomuch, as pious reading, that it may be an help to Devotion, ought to be done with a moſt devout In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, without which Condition it will be a very hard matter to make any progreſs in it.</p>
               <p>But, as much as the reading of good Books brings in Auxiliaries to Devotion, ſo much it is ruined by the reading of bad ones. 'Tis a great ſhame to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> that now adays it makes more account of ſome miſchievous Books than ever did the moſt corrupted <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> Our Age, and in particular, this Kingdom, might be juſtly noted with Infamy for that ſwarm of <hi>Romances</hi> which the effeminacy of our Hearts, the corruption of our Minds, and the wiles of the Devil, have ſent into the World. We muſt needs be great Lovers of <hi>Lying,</hi> ſince fifty Years have produced more Fables than ſix thouſand Years could produce Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:151353:108"/>and the Church muſt needs be very much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, to ſuffer, and (as it were) to authorize ſuch ſhameleſs Products, ſo full of impure Imaginations. Every devout Soul will have thoſe <hi>Legends</hi> in Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation; for, certain it is, that nothing puts the Heart into greater Diſorder. I wiſh People be ſafe from the <hi>laſt</hi> Corruption, and they proceed not even to the acting and imitating thoſe irregular Examples in good earneſt which they ſaw before in Jeſt: however, 'tis ſure, that from the reading of theſe Books the Mind returns loaded with Images, which grieve and drive away the Spirit of God, and which are abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Spirit of Devotion.</p>

                  <p>IF thou art ignorant, O my Soul, in the things which concern thy Salvation, it's wholly thy own fault: Thy God opens two great books before thine Eyes, where thou mayſt be taught and inſtructed in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Heaven and of thy Salvation. Often have I caſt my Eyes upon Nature, upon Heaven, Earth, the Mountains, Rivers, Fields, and Foreſts: oft have I carried my Eyes to the Planets and to the Stars. But to my confuſion, I avow, theſe Contemplations were barren, done negligently without Application and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion. Do that therefore now, O my Soul, which thou haſt never done yet: view the Heavens and admire their Greatneſs and vaſt Extenſion; Acknowledge the Greatneſs of the Maker, his Strength, his Wiſdom, his Power: See how he has on purpoſe painted himſelf in all places, and left his foot-ſteps whereſoever he hath paſt. Look upon the Sun, which pours forth ſo much fire, which men call the Light of the World: This is the Image of Thy God, who is Light himſelf: <hi>In thee is the Well of Life, and in thy Light ſhall we ſee Light.</hi> That innumerable multitude of fires that burn in the Firmament, is the Emblem of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Souls, which ſhine in the higheſt Heaven of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:151353:109"/>bleſſed. The rapidity of thoſe vaſt and prodigious Machines, which roul over thy head, ought to make thee think of that robuſt Art which gives them their ſwing and impreſſes upon 'em their Motions. The equality and juſtneſs of thoſe Motions, as regular as ſwift, preaches to thee the Wiſdom and Evenneſs of God's Actions, who does nothing but what is juſt and reaſonable. The magnificence of thoſe viſible Heavens may without much ado conduct thy Meditation to the thought of another life, and give thee ſome foretaſte and conception of the Glory God prepares for thee in Paradice. Thoſe viſible heavens ſo Splendid, ſo Beautiful, are but the threſhold of that Palace. where God makes ready an abode for thee. Oh my Soul how Rich and Glorious muſt that houſe be, whoſe very Avenues and Entries are ſo fine and pompous; If from the heavens thou deſcendeſt into the Air, which is the region of Storms and Tempeſts, of Rains and Dews; in the latter thou wilt ſee the Emblems of God's Favour, and in the former, the Meſſengers of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and the Inſtruments of his Fury. The one will lead thee to the Conſideration of his Juſtice, and the other to the Conſideration of his Mercy. If thou deſcendeſt to the Earth, thou wilt diſcover almoſt every where around thee an incredible multitude of ſundry Objects, that will inſtruct thee divers ways: Some as well as the Heavens will ſpeak to thee of God's Wiſdom and Power; Others will tell thee of thy own Weakneſs, and Vanity of Death, and the Neceſſity of dying, of the Inconſtancy of humane things, and will give thee an hundred other Leſſons. But all this is nothing to compare with the Knowledge, to be had from the reading of that other book, which God hath dictated to his Prophets and Apoſtles. 'Tis there thou mayeſt ſee the Abyſſes of the Divine Wiſdom, the infinity of his Love, and the depths of his Mercy. Without engaging thy ſelf very deep in theſe Abyſſes,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:151353:109"/>what Fruit canſt thou not reap from the Death of my Saviour and the Contemplation of his Croſs? thou wilt learn there how thou art to love, for that is the School of Love: thou wilt view thy Divine Saviour eaten up with the zeal of God's Houſe, burnt with the Flames of Charity. He ſo loved the World that he gave himſelf up to Death for the World; and that to a ſhameful, cruel, and tormenting death, even that of the Croſs. He expos'd himſelf to all the arrows of God's Wrath; he ſuckt the venom, and underwent the weight of his Indignation, and for whom? for his Enemies. 'Tis thus, O my Soul, thou muſt Love: This is but a very ſmall part of the things thou mayſt learn in that heavenly Book.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>The fourth particular help to Devotion; The uſe of Prayer.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Do not deſign here to make any Commendation of Prayer, nor to diſplay all it's Uſes; which both the Antients and Moderns have done very Amply. I ſhall only ſay, that 'tis one of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt means to purifie the Soul; ſince there is no Action whereby we approach nearer to God, no time wherein he communicates himſelf more to us. He hath been very often obſerv'd to give his Extraordinary inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Prayer. In praying St <hi>Peter</hi> fell into an Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <hi>Paul</hi> was raviſht to the third Heaven; <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his Prayers receiv'd the Viſion of an Angel: <hi>Monica</hi> St <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Mother after her Prayers and Tears for the Salvation of her Son, had in her dream that excellent Revelation of his Converſion. An Angel tells her, <hi>Afflict not thy ſelf, thy Son is with thee.</hi> As God is the Sun of our Soul, and jets his beams perpendicularly into our Hearts, he muſt neceſſarily clarifie and heat them; he diſperſes the vapours of the Inferiour part and draws his own Image there. Now this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Raies of Grace is never made more than in Prayer.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſtay to examine any further the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with which Prayers ſhould be made to be Devout: it's already ſhown enough, that they ought to be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, Perſevering and Ardent: I ſhall only give here two Advices, the one to avoid Wearineſs, the other to avoid Diſtraction. Firſt I ſay, that few Souls are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of long Prayers: For to render a Prayer perfectly devout there's need of an extreme Contention of Mind, an extraordinary Elevation, and an entire looſening ones ſelf from the World. Now theſe Actions do a kind of Violence to the Soul, which naturally tends to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:151353:110"/>a releaſing of it ſelf; and therefore they cannot be of any long Continuance. If we give no relaxation to the Heart, it takes it, and rambles ſome where or other in ſpite of our teeth: ſo as I would have the exerciſes of Devotion to be long, tho divided into little ſpaces of time; that they have many parts, and each of 'em be ſhort. Devotion is compoſed of three principal Acts, Reading, Meditation, and Prayer: each of theſe need not be done preſently, ſo as to follow one another, but they may be mingled: for we muſt allow ſome grains to the Souls Weakneſs, and we muſt keep it from diſguſt by variety: A little reading may be the firſt degree of it's Elevation; a little meditation on that reading will lift it a degree higher; and after the reading and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, a ſhort Prayer will lead it to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of forgetting the World: after which, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn wholly new to reading and Meditation in the ſame order. In Prayer, it will fly through the Air by the force of its own Wings: and, at its return to reading, it will do like thoſe Birds, that, weary with flying, come to repoſe themſelves, not on the Earth, but ſome very high Tree of their own choice; ſo our devout Soul will come to reſt it ſelf, not by falling on the Earth, for 'twill never ſet foot there, nor permit the mind to return to the World; but it will continue elevated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Props of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> will ſuſtain it, lifted up towards the Heaven, and from thence taking its flight, it will by little and little riſe upon the Wings of Meditation, untill it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by Prayers whither it was firſt lifted up. This method, undoubtedly, will give it time to renew its ſtrength; it cannot hold out long, if its courſe be puſh'd on to the utmoſt of its vigour; but by taking breath, and marching fairly on from time to time, it will make a very great advance in a day.</p>
               <p>The other Direction I would give, regards thoſe, who having not been buſied about the operations of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:151353:111"/>the Mind, are leſs proper for the great Elevations. Theſe People ordinarily make their Devotions in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pronounced by heart; from which way Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are almoſt inſeparable. Theſe I would counſel to endeavour to untye themſelves from Words, and hold only to the Senſe. I do not mean, that in their Family-Prayers they ſhould diſpenſe themſelves from their Forms: I know very well that all the World has not the gift of forming their thoughts, and putting them into an order which may edifie the Publick; but for the Devotions of the Cloſet, they are rather to be made by Heart than by the Tongue. When the Imagination does not make ſome endeavour for the production of its Thoughts and the choice of its Words, in following the beaten Road, which it fears not to loſe; it never fails of going ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whither elſe, as having nothing to do in the place where we would retain it: but when it gives Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the manner in which is neceſſary to expreſs the things which the Heart has conceiv'd, the Heart and the Imagination uniting their Forces make up a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Attention. I cannot endure to hear ſome ſay, That all the World is not capable of compoſing: all are not able to compoſe for Men, but to compoſe for God they are able. Let us make never ſuch Efforts to ſpeak well, we ſtammer in the Mouth before the Lord: and with relation to God, there can be no other difference betwixt the moſt eloquent and him that is leaſt ſo, than between one Child and another. God underſtandeth all Languages and all Stiles; he requires no Order nor Elegance; the moſt confuſed Thoughts, that come in a Crowd from the Heart, are often moſt pleaſing to him: he hears the Sighs of the Dumb, he knows what we deſire better than we can ſpeak or oftentimes conceive: for, <hi>The Spirit of God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>maketh Interceſſion for us with Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which cannot be uttered.</hi> After all, there are none
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:151353:111"/>but know what they want, and by conſequence, none but can pray; for, Prayer is nothing but a weaving of Deſires for thoſe things which we ſtand in need of for the preſent Life, the Salvation of the Soul, and the Life to come. The Paſſions are eloquent, and the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is warmed by its ſympathy with the Heart; wherefore, thoſe Perſons that excuſe themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſmallneſs of their Light, when they are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with Choler never want Words: and certainly, if their Heart be heated with the Fire of Devotion, the Imagination will be very ſenſible of it, and they cannot complain of want of Thoughts or Expreſſions.</p>

                  <p>THou haſt never well compriſed, O my Soul, how much honour thy God does thee in permitting thee to caſt thy ſelf at his Feet; thou art not ſenſible of this Favour. Thou believeſt that God does owe thee it for that thou wilt humble thy ſelf before him. Thou remembreſt not how dear and ſcarce are the Audiences before the Kings of the earth, which yet are in the preſence of God but a Shadow, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The King of Kings is pleaſed to lend his ear to thee, to hear thee, to ſuccour thee; his Throne is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible at all times. To approach thither there is no need either of Favour or Friends, or Credit, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sollicitations, or troubleſome Attendings: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, what is that Throne, and how great its Magnificence and Glory! Thereon God is ſeated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with a Light whoſe luſtre dazles the eyes of <hi>Seraphims;</hi> all around millions of Angels and Arch-Angels falling upon their Faces: on the right hand Rivers of Milk and Honey, which his Children drink of; on the left are Torrents of Fire to devour his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; on the one ſide is Hell and Death, and the dreadful Miniſters of Divine Vengeance, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heaven and Paradiſe, with the glorious Rewards which God prepares for thoſe whom he loves. Thou
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:151353:112"/>doſt not ſee this, O my Soul, and therefore thou art the leſs touch'd; but thou oughtſt to believe it though the Veil of thy Fleſh rob thee of the fight. Therefore repreſent to thy ſelf the Magnificence of that Throne, tremble, admire, and be fill'd with Gratitude; for that being corrupted by the Commerce thou haſt with a miſerable Body, abiding in an Houſe of Clay, and having thy Seat in the Duſt, thou canſt, nevertheleſs, at all times with liberty preſent thy ſelf before him who ſits upon the Cherubims, who flies upon the Wings of the Wind, who maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a Flame of Fire. Thou haſt the permiſſion to pray, but thou knoweſt not how to pray, and that becauſe thou knoweſt not to love. One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friend never wants things to diſcourſe on to another: when our Heart is perfectly opened to any one, and we have received his Soul into our Breaſt, we are never ſhort. Alas, my Soul! If thou lovedſt thy God perfectly thou wouldſt be never weary with entertaining him; never would thy Imagination be congealed, thy Tongue remain ſpeechleſs, or thou want Words; thy Mouth would pour it ſelf forth like a Torrent, and thy Prayers would roul like a Flame: but thou languiſheſt in thy Prayers, ſince thou doſt not ſpeak to God as thy neareſt and beſt Friend; the barrenneſs of thy Heart comes from the coldneſs of thy Love.</p>

               </head>
               <p>NONE can deny, that Faſting and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are moſt neceſſary helps to Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs they will deny the Scripture, and the Maximes of the Fathers of the Church. The Scripture ſeldom ſeparates Prayer from Faſting: it gives to both joyntly the force of driving away the moſt dangerous Demons. <hi>This kind of Devil goeth not out but by Prayer and Faſting.</hi> The Fleſh is an head-ſtrong Horſe, which we cannot manage but by holding in the Bridle; it's a Lion, which we muſt not feed ſo long till he is grown fat, unleſs we would aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his Cruelty, and caſt our ſelves into the danger of being devoured by him. The Body (if we mark) is the ſame Fleſh, whereof the Goſpel complains ſo ſtrongly and in ſo many places: of which 'tis ſaid, that it is an Enemy to God, and its fruits are Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Strife, Sedition, Murder, Hatred, Envying, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and Covetouſneſs. So that to hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of theſe fruits. 'tis good to keep this plant in continual great dryneſs: for if we beſprinkle this root of bitterneſs with carnal Pleaſures, it will ſhoot up its ſprouts on high, and turn us out of the way of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. As plants, which are very tall, and ſurmount their Neighbours, leave them in a bad Eſtate, in ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the fatneſs of the Earth from 'em: ſo the Fleſh grows not fat but at the Expence of the Soul, which it deprives of Comfort, and leaves it in a great bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fruit. A great meal is a very bad preparative for the duties of Piety: we cannot be in the Kitchin and the Cloſet at the ſame time: and while the Soul is employ'd in its Rooms about ſeething and digeſting
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:151353:113"/>its Victuals and diſtributing its Nouriſhment, it is not in a ſtate to be tranſported in places deſtin'd to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and Meditation. It lyes groveling beneath thick Clouds and foggy Vapours, which render the heart unfit to lift it ſelf up. <q>The abundance of delicious meats [ſays a Father] ſend ſmoky Exhalations like Clouds that interrupt the Illumination, which is made in the underſtanding by the Holy Ghoſt. Wherefore <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he might ſee God without a Cloud, ſtayed forty days upon the Mount without eating or drinking, with deſign that the ſuperiour part of his Soul might remain diſengag'd from Trouble, and the Obſcurities of the lower part. Eaſe and Abundance of Bread cauſe the ſins of <hi>Sodom:</hi>
                  </q> and Uncleanneſs of of Life is the conſequence of the mouth's Exceſs. After the uſe of many delicate meats and drinks, the blood is all over inflam'd, which gives a Diſpoſition to all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Actions, and an Inclination to worldly Joy, which is ever immoderate. <hi>The People ſat down to eat and to drink and roſe up to play.</hi> We muſt therefore, of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, obſerve the Rules of Sobriety, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the Body only for Life's ſake, We muſt give it what is neceſſary, and deny it ſuperfluities, that it be never able to rebell againſt us. And frequently we muſt retrench, even the neceſſary things, that we may maſter it the more: for the Fleſh when kept under, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes much to make the heart contrite; and the leſs tye the Soul has to the Body, the more eaſily it lifts it ſelf up to God. When we faſt our Devotions are not interrupted by ſleep; they are not corrupted by involuntary Motions; they are not viciated by diſhoneſt Thoughts. In the mean while, touching the practice and uſe of Faſting, divers advices may be given. Firſt, we are not to hold it for a part of Devotion, and as a worſhip wherewith we ſerve God: <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is neither meat nor drink:</hi> it is only an help to Devotion. This firſt conſideration furniſhes us
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:151353:114"/>with an other: which is, that we uſe not faſting as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion it ſelf; for to faſt whilſt we are travelling, or about our Employments, is no work of great merit or great uſe. The firſt conſideration has a third ſtill that ſprings from it: and that is, that Faſting is not to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd no farther in Devotion than as it may be an aid to it: and by conſequence we cannot give any certain rules either for the Practice, or the Duration of it. Some tempers there are ſo weak, that faſting is ſo far from being an help to Devotion, as it may be a great lett to it; becauſe it immediately caſts the body into a certain negligence, which hinders the Soul from ſoaring up. Again, there are thoſe can't be tamed but by long mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and theſe ought not to ſpare themſelves. Others maſter 'emſelves more eaſily, and theſe muſt know themſelves; but nevertheleſs they are to take care that the weakneſs of their body do not ſerve for a pretext to diſpence themſelves from neceſſary morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>Yet we cannot approve thoſe cruelties which ſome uſe towards the body, in treating it like a declared Enemy, without ſparing either Fire or Sword. We put not on here the Spirit of Controverſie, we leave every one to his own Conſcience. We ſay only, that altho thoſe exceſſes be not new, they are never the better for all that. Ecceſiaſtical Hiſtory ſupplies us with examples enow, I confeſs, of theſe extravagant Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: But I had rather ſtand to the diciſion of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who is not to be ſuſpected in this cauſe, ſince he was a great Aſſociate in Faſtings and Mortifications However he repeats many times the precept of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, and inſiſts very long upon it. He denyes his Virgins and his Hermits the uſe of exceſſive Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even to his ſaving [in the Book of Virginity] <q>that the burthen of heavy and exceſſively pamper'd Fleſh does not bring more incumbrance to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul, than the weakneſs of a ſick Body,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:151353:114"/>thinn'd by a long and exceſſive Mortification.</q> And therefore he expreſly orders, That neceſſity be the rule of Faſting and Abſtinence.</p>
               <p>And now follows another neceſſary Direction upon this Subject; That bodily Mortification and Faſting does not reach to the very bottom of the Soul, nor mortifie all ſort of Vice. An Ancient ſaid, That the <q>Devil being not able to lay hold or take Poſſeſſion of a Body maſter'd by great Mortifications, ſeizes upon the Soul all naked, and by it, and in it, begins and conſummates the carnal Deſires.</q> If the Soul without the Body be capable of acting and committing bodily Sins though Mortification be in the way, how ſhall it heal it ſelf, by this means, of thoſe Diſeaſes which are intirely in it, as Envy, Pride, and Self-love? So we ſee theſe Paſſions reign very often and very imperiouſly in thoſe Men of Scourges and Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. This ſo bloody War which is wag'd againſt the Body, and, in appearance, renounces all Self-love, can be no more, in the moſt part, than a Self-love very delicate, which leads to Glory by extraordinary Paths, that it may arrive there the more ſurely. From all this, I conclude, that the Mortification which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of us, when he ſays, <hi>Mortifie your Members which are upon the Earth,</hi> and that which we have judged neceſſary for Devotion, goes much farther than bodily Mortification. To ſtifle that Self-love, that Pride, thoſe Jealouſies, Harreds, Envyings, and even Ambition and Covetouſneſs, there is need of another ſort of Faſting; that is, an Abſtinence from all Actions which may nouriſh thoſe Vices. So I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter with thoſe incomparable Words of the Father, <q>Beware of defining the excellence of Faſting, by a ſole Abſtinence from Meats and Drinks; for true Faſting conſiſts in abſtaining from Evil. Thou doſt not eat Fleſh, but thou teareſt thy Brother in pieces; thou abſtaineſt from Wine,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:151353:115"/>but thou abſtaineſt not from doing Outrage; thou waiteſt till the Evening to eat, but thou ſpendeſt the day in a Law Suit. Woe to thoſe that are drunk, though not with Wine. Anger inebriates the Soul, and, as well as Wine, caſts it out of the limits of Reaſon.</q>

                  <p>THIS of wine, I confeſs, is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Drunkenneſs, and Gluttony is a moſt filthy ſin. Theſe ſins are great Enemies to Devotion: and therefore Faſting, Abſtinence and Sobriety are very neceſſary to ſuccour and nouriſh Piety. But, O my Soul, take care of thy ſelf, theſe vices regard the body chiefly. There is another ſort of Drunkenneſs and Gluttony which immediately concerns the Soul, and is, it may be, ſtill more dangerous: this Drunkenneſs is Pride, and this Gluttony is Avarice and Ambition. How many Souls do I ſee in the World made drunk with Vanity and an high Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! They are fly-blown with Pride, that all the Earth cannot contain them, they ſtretch themſelves ſo far and are lift up ſo high. This Drunkenneſs cauſes them to make a thouſand Trips and falſe Steps; their Footings are ever awry and oblique,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:151353:115"/>like thoſe of drunken Men; they have a great Conceit of their own Wiſdom, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Strength: all this fails 'em ſometimes, they reel, ſtagger, and at laſt fall; for Pride comes before Ruin. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy ſelf, O my Soul! ſee if thou haſt not a tincture of this Evil, and if thou be not inebriated with the Thought of thy own Righteouſneſs and thy own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Alas, if thou denyeſt it thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelf ill! This is a great Pride, the belief of having none; for, it is to believe thou art worth as much as thou eſteemeſt thy ſelf; but there is no Man but eſteems himſelf more than he is really worth. Thou wilt ſay to me, perhaps, thou haſt an ill Opinion of thy ſelf; but be aſſured, O my Soul, thou doſt not contemn thy ſelf ſo much as thou art contemptible. If thou contemn thy ſelf, thou makeſt a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that Contempt, ſo as there is Pride affix'd to the Contempt thou haſt of thy ſelf. The other Vice, which is the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony of the Soul, is no leſs dangerous. View thoſe Men that devour, that are continually laying violent hands on the Prey, and never ſay, <hi>It is enough;</hi> thoſe ambitious and covetous Perſons, who ſuck up the Subſtance of the Poor, who eat up
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:151353:116"/>Gods People like bread, or who at leaſt labour with an unconceivable deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and aggrandize themſelves; who go to ſeek the utmoſt bounds of the World, and yet put no end to their deſires, who can mount up to the higheſt pinacle of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet cannot fill the abyſs of their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Have a care, O my Soul, of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into theſe exceſſes, for he who hungers after Silver, will never be ſatisfied with Silver. Quench the fire of thy Avarice; for if thou furniſh it with food, thou wilt nouriſh it: it will devour thy entrails, and peradventure cauſe ſuch a Flame as will conſume both thee and thy Neighbours. I muſt not then neglect corporal faſting: but the principal one is Humility, that will guard me from the Drunkenneſs of Pride, and a contentment of Mind, that will make me deſpiſe ſuperfluous things, ſo as I ſhall be content with thoſe which are neceſſary. This is the true Sobriety of the Soul: theſe two vertues walk hand in hand together. Be thou humble, O my Soul, and thou wilt be content with thy Fortune: know how little thou art worth, and thou wilt be perſuaded thou haſt more than thou deſerveſt.</p>

                  <p>O <hi>Lord, make me to know my ſelf, that I am nothing. It is certain that I am nothing: but yet I cannot confeſs it. My mouth ſays it, yet my heart doth not agree thereto: and I always feel within me the Devil of Pride, that ſollicites me, and ſays to me in a low Voice: ſenſeleſs as thou art, why ſpeakeſt thou of thy ſelf with ſo much ſcorn? If thou doſt not eſteem thy ſelf, who ſhall eſteem thee? Are men oblig'd to have a better Opinion of thee than thou haſt of thy ſelf; ſince thou muſt needs know thy ſelf better than they can know thee? if I humble my ſelf before thee, O Lord, it is, becauſe</hi> I <hi>look upon this as of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, by reaſon of the enormous diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is betwixt thee and me. But with men I keep to great meaſures, I try to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and to give them a vaſt Opinion of my ſelf: I ſtrive to keep up my rank, to be valued, and I can ſuffer no ſlight or contempt. O mercifull Jeſus, who didſt humble thy ſelf, even to death, inſpire thy Humility into me, and recover me from being overwhelmed with my Pride; ſo that being perſuaded I deſerve nothing, I may be evermore content with all thou beſtoweſt upon me; that Godlineſs and content of mind may be my great gain; ſo I have as much food and cloathing as is ſufficient.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I HAVE done with the Directions I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to help Devotion; but before I conclude, I believe there is ſome Conſolation due to truly Devout Perſons, of whom ſo bad a Judgment is made in the World. Some put them all into the rank of Hypocrites; Theſe are our falſe <hi>Devoto's,</hi> ſay the profane, who obſerve forms ſo exactly; who are careful to be at all pious Ordinances; who lend ſo great an attention to a Sermon; who pray and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with ſo many viſible marks of Devotion: we are never the leſs good Chriſtians for our little Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we have what's ſolid in piety, and they the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance only. It muſt be confeſt, Hypocriſie doth a great deal of harm to Devotion: I do not deny there are falſely devout People; there's hardly any veil, wherewith evil Conſciences cover themſelves more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily than with this of Godlineſs. But becauſe ſome Hypocrites there be, is it neceſſary there are none others? Becauſe we find counterfeit Diamonds, can none find true and effective ones? becauſe there are falſe and fooliſh fires, is there then no true light? Some indeed believe they have found out a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt this miſchief; they affect an apparent Indevotion: for having ſome zeal at the bottom they imagine 'tis neceſſary to affect a Way and an Air of indifference to avoid the Accuſation of Hypocriſie, but this is to avoid one evil by a greater: and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the neceſſity either of committing a Crime, or of being the occaſion of one, we are to determine on the latter. We are commanded to make the light of our good Works to ſhine before men, and to edifie our

                  </gap>uſly endeavour to hide their Devotion, do not hide my great thing from us; they have little enough within. When a Chamber is fill'd with fire the light appears thorough the Windows; Piety is a fire that caſts its flame through all our vertues, tho never ſo much care be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aken to conceal it. If the heart be full of godly zeal, it will appear upon the Tongue, in the Hands, and even in the Eyes. True, no affectation is to be us'd: God hates thoſe pompous and vain-glorious Pieties, which expoſe 'emſelves at the corners of Streets, and which wholly conſiſt in the liftings up of the hands, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouling of the Eyes, and a wan and deadiſh Viſage: Devotions the more ſecret they are, the better: But how eaſie is it to diſtinguiſh Sincerity from affectation. If theſe prophane Judges did but know themſelves a little they would not confound a modeſt Piety and ſage Devotion, which ſhines only thorough the veil of a profound Humility, with a Devotion made up of Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maces. The Life, Converſation and Manners are the beſt touch-ſtone to know the Sincerity of Devotion. If the devout Perſon is Covetous, Ambitious, one that grows rich at the expence of the Poor, or that is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative, I agree we may put ſuch an one in the rank of counterfeits. But if the Life, in all reſpects, be unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable, 'tis a Sin worthy of all the flames in Hell to judge that the Devotion is feign'd: 'tis a ſort of Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, like to that which the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were guilty of againſt our Saviour, in accuſing him that he did through the help of the Devil, what he did by the Finger and Spirit of God. Theſe prophane men do the ſame thing; to the evil ſpirit of Hypocriſie, they attribute the immediate works of God's Spirit. But ſay ſome, tho theſe ſame devouts appear regular in their Life, it's becauſe they ave the Addreſs, Dexterity and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:151353:118"/>Knack not to diſcover their impurities: the love of their Reputation engaging 'em to uſe ſuch Precautions as hinder the publick from taking notice of their crimes. But is not this to violate all ſorts of Rights, to invade even thoſe of God himſelf, to undertake to ſee into the Heart? Is it not to violate the <hi>aſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lums</hi> of Secreſie, to judge boldly of what doth not appear to the World? Is it not to goe againſt all the rules of good Senſe, to judge a man is wicked, becauſe he appears to be good. To conclude, I ſay, if we were to declare for the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or the prophane Libertine, the latter is to be baniſht rather than the former. The Hypocrite, at leaſt has the moity of a Chriſtian, tho he hath but the leaſt part: his Externals make to Edification, and his falſe Godlineſs may enkindle what is true. But the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine hath it neither within nor without: he offends God, ſcandalizes his Neighbour; he undoes others as well as himſelf. I ſhut up all then with counſelling our devout Perſon to affect nothing, yet to take heed of hiding his Devotion under the Veil of Indifference for the ſatisfaction of Libertines; to be an exact Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter of holy Aſſemblies; to hear with Attention; to pray with Ardour; not to diſpenſe himſelf from the external Actions of Humility, but without being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively given to Appearances. After this, let him ſet himſelf above the Judgment of indevout People: God who ſees the ſincerity of his Heart will reward him, and puniſh thoſe raſh Judges moſt ſeverely.</p>
